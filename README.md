# mod-llm-chatter

**Every hero has a story. Your companions are ready to tell theirs.**

A fantasy roleplay conversation engine for [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org/) WotLK (3.3.5a) and [mod-playerbots](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots). It replaces the silence of automated bots with personality-driven, lore-grounded dialogue, giving every companion a voice shaped by their race, class, and the world around them. Whether you're soloing through the cursed woods of Duskwood, descending into the titan halls of Ulduar with a full raid, or clashing over flags in Warsong Gulch, your party feels like a band of adventurers sharing a journey through Azeroth.

Built from the ground up for **fantasy roleplay immersion**. Every system, personalities, memories, prompts, spatial awareness, is designed to keep bots speaking as inhabitants of Azeroth, not as AI assistants breaking the fourth wall.

## Features

* **Roleplay-first characters**: Bots speak as distinct inhabitants of
  Azeroth, shaped by race, class, talents, personality, and lore. Natural
  pacing, multi-character flow, emotes, and voices keep conversations
  immersive.
* **Persistent personalities and histories**: Each companion keeps a stable
  identity, generated backstory, and memories of shared dungeons, bosses,
  achievements, and milestones. Backstories can be viewed or regenerated
  through the Chatter Companion addon.
* **Location and world awareness**: More than 3,000 zone and subzone
  descriptions ground dialogue in the surrounding lore. Bots notice nearby
  creatures, NPCs, objects, points of interest, weather, time, transports,
  and holidays.
* **Interactive parties**: Companions banter with one another, ask the player
  questions, and react to combat, loot, quests, achievements, and travel.
* **Living public channels**: Ambient General chat, proximity `/say`, player
  replies, battleground callouts, and encounter-aware raid dialogue make the
  wider world feel populated.
* **Social guild chat**: Guildmates greet returning players, answer messages,
  hold conversations, and carry shared context forward during a session.
* **Non-blocking architecture**: LLM work runs in a separate, concurrent
  bridge service. Worldserver queues events and delivers completed responses
  without waiting on provider calls.

## Quick Start

1. Clone into `modules/` and build AzerothCore
2. Copy `conf/mod_llm_chatter.conf.dist` to your config directory and name it `mod_llm_chatter.conf`
3. Set `LLMChatter.Provider`, `LLMChatter.Model`, and the matching API
   key (Ollama does not need a key)
4. Start worldserver once, or run `dbimport`, so AzerothCore applies the module's character database schema
5. Start the Python bridge
6. Play, bots start chatting when grouped with players

See [Setup](#setup) below for detailed Docker, non-Docker, and SQL preparation steps.

## Compatibility

This module requires a working AzerothCore server with mod-playerbots. If you don't have one yet, start here:

- [AzerothCore Docker install guide](https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/install-with-docker)
- [AzerothCore Playerbot branch](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/azerothcore-wotlk/tree/Playerbot)
- [mod-playerbots](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots)

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| AzerothCore | [Playerbot branch](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/azerothcore-wotlk/tree/Playerbot) (WotLK 3.3.5a) |
| mod-playerbots | [liyunfan1223/mod-playerbots](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots) |
| Python | 3.10+ |
| LLM Provider | DeepSeek or Ollama |

Install the Python bridge dependencies from `tools/requirements.txt`.
Both providers are reached through the `openai` SDK's OpenAI-compatible
client; installing packages individually can bypass the module's
compatibility constraints.

### Recommended Models

- **DeepSeek Flash** (DeepSeek), the default: fast and very cheap. Keep
  `LLMChatter.DeepSeek.ReasoningEffort = none`, because DeepSeek turns
  thinking on by default
- **DeepSeek V4 Pro** (DeepSeek), higher quality at a higher cost and
  latency

Ollama is supported for local/free inference, but the module's structured
JSON, system/user messages, emotes, and actions demand strong instruction
following. Smaller open-source models may not deliver it consistently. For
the best experience, use DeepSeek Flash. See the config header for more
provider guidance.

### Provider and Model Setup

Configuration uses unquoted `Key = value` lines. Copy model IDs exactly:
DeepSeek IDs look like `deepseek-flash`, and Ollama IDs use the name and
tag shown by `ollama list`.
Leave an optional value empty after `=`. Keep comments on separate lines;
the chatter parser treats an inline comment as part of the value.

| Provider | Provider value | Model setting | Credential |
|----------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| DeepSeek | `deepseek` | Exact DeepSeek model ID | `LLMChatter.DeepSeek.ApiKey` |
| Ollama | `ollama` | A name/tag from `ollama list` | None |

Ready-to-copy examples (replace only the placeholder key):

```ini
# DeepSeek (default)
LLMChatter.Provider = deepseek
LLMChatter.Model = deepseek-flash
LLMChatter.DeepSeek.ApiKey = sk-xxxxx
LLMChatter.DeepSeek.ReasoningEffort = none

# Local Ollama from a Docker bridge
LLMChatter.Provider = ollama
LLMChatter.Model = qwen3:8b
LLMChatter.Ollama.BaseUrl = http://host.docker.internal:11434
```

Use only one provider recipe at a time. Existing credentials for the
inactive provider can remain in the file. Restart `ac-llm-chatter-bridge`
after a provider or model change. The bridge chooses compatible token,
temperature, and reasoning parameters automatically, then caches any
explicit unsupported-parameter correction for the rest of that process.

DeepSeek enables thinking by default, so the bridge always states the
choice and reads an empty `DeepSeek.ReasoningEffort` as `none`. Any other
effort (`low`, `high`, `max`) turns thinking on, at which point DeepSeek
ignores `temperature` and spends thinking tokens from the output budget —
raise `DeepSeek.MaxTokensMultiplier` if replies come back truncated.

For Ollama, run `ollama pull <model>` on the Ollama host first. A host-run
bridge normally uses `http://localhost:11434`; a Docker bridge normally uses
`http://host.docker.internal:11434`. Do not append `/v1` to the configured
base URL.

Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint does not accept a per-request context
size. Set `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH` before starting Ollama, or create a custom
model whose Modelfile contains `PARAMETER num_ctx 4096`. Confirm the loaded
value in the `CONTEXT` column from `ollama ps`. `Ollama.DisableThinking = 1`
uses both the supported `reasoning_effort = none` request and `/no_think`
fallback for compatible local models.

### Mixing Providers Per Feature

One provider does not have to serve everything. Each feature can name
its own provider and model, so the high-volume background chatter can
run on a local model while the lines players actually read come from a
cloud model — or the other way round.

```ini
# Bulk chatter stays local and free
LLMChatter.Provider = ollama
LLMChatter.Model = qwen3:8b

# Party and guild talk goes to the cloud
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.Provider = deepseek
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.Model = deepseek-flash
LLMChatter.GuildChatter.Provider = deepseek
LLMChatter.GuildChatter.Model = deepseek-flash
```

Or keep the cloud as the default and push background work to a local
model, where latency does not matter because no one is waiting:

```ini
LLMChatter.Provider = deepseek
LLMChatter.Model = deepseek-flash

LLMChatter.Memory.Provider = ollama
LLMChatter.Memory.Model = qwen3:8b
LLMChatter.Backstory.Provider = ollama
LLMChatter.Backstory.Model = qwen3:8b
```

Routable features: `GroupChatter`, `ProximityChatter`, `GuildChatter`,
`GeneralChat`, `BGChatter`, `RaidChatter`, `Memory`, `Backstory`, and
`QuickAnalyze`. Ambient zone chatter always uses the main provider —
it is the baseline, so route the others away from it instead.

Two rules worth knowing:

- **`Provider` alone only works where the new provider has a default
  model.** DeepSeek has one; Ollama does not, since there is no model
  tag to assume. Routing to Ollama needs a `Model` line too.
- **An override that cannot be satisfied is ignored**, and the feature
  quietly stays on the main provider rather than sending a request
  certain to fail. The startup health check lists every active route
  and warns about any override it had to ignore, so check the report
  after editing.

`QuickAnalyze` covers the short classification calls — such as working
out which bot a player is addressing. It defaults to the provider's
fast model rather than `LLMChatter.Model`, because a player waits on
that call before any bot answers.

After editing routes, confirm them with
`chatter_latency_probe.py --all-routes` (see
[Chatter feels slow? Measure it](#chatter-feels-slow-measure-it)). It
calls each route's real endpoint and prints the provider, model, and
latency it got back.

### Tuning the Chattiness

The default config ships on the **chatty side** so you can
experience all the features out of the box. If you prefer a
quieter, more immersive atmosphere, the key knobs are below.

An optional lower-volume template is available at
[`conf/presets/mod_ll_chatter_quieter.conf.dist`](conf/presets/mod_ll_chatter_quieter.conf.dist).
It is not automatically installed or loaded. To use it, back up your active
config, then copy the preset to your server's module-config directory as
`mod_llm_chatter.conf` and configure its database and provider credentials.
Keep alternate presets in `conf/presets/`: files directly under
`conf/*.conf.dist` are registered as required config filenames at build time.

**Reducing General channel chatter** (ambient bot conversations
in zone-wide chat):

```ini
# How often each zone is checked for ambient chatter
LLMChatter.TriggerIntervalSeconds = 60  # default 30, try 60-90

# Chance per check that bots start talking unprompted
LLMChatter.TriggerChance = 10            # default 15, try 5-10

# Chance that ambient chatter becomes a multi-bot conversation
LLMChatter.ConversationChance = 30      # default 40, try 15-20

# World event reactions (weather, transports, holidays)
LLMChatter.EventReactionChance = 10     # default 25, try 10-15
```

**Reducing party chatter** (group chat while questing):

```ini
# Idle chatter frequency and cooldown
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.IdleCheckInterval = 60  # default 30
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.IdleChance = 10          # default 15
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.IdleCooldown = 90       # default 40

# Quest reactions (accept, objectives, turn-in)
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.QuestAcceptChance = 30    # default 50
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.QuestObjectiveChance = 30 # default 50
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.QuestCompleteChance = 30  # default 50

# Combat reactions
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.KillChanceNormal = 5    # default 20
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.SpellCastChance = 10    # default 30

# Nearby object/creature comments
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.NearbyObjectChance = 5  # default 20
```

All values are percentages (0-100) unless noted. Setting any
chance to `0` disables that trigger entirely. See the config
file comments for the full list of tunable keys.

### Choosing the Voice Per Channel

`LLMChatter.ChatterMode` sets the default voice — `normal` (people
playing WoW), `roleplay` (characters living in Azeroth), or `mixed`.
It is a default, not a verdict: the right voice is not the same in
every place bots talk. In-character banter reads well in zone or guild
chat and badly in the middle of a dungeon pull.

Two things follow from that, and both are on by default:

* **Roleplay yields inside instances.** In a dungeon, raid,
  battleground, or arena, party/raid/BG chat drops to the plain player
  voice. Zone, guild, and `/say` chat are untouched, so a roleplay
  server keeps its in-character world and still gets readable chat
  during a run. Turn it off with
  `LLMChatter.Roleplay.SuppressInInstances = 0` if you want
  in-character raids.
* **Instanced party chat gets tighter.** Practical and reactive, with
  idle chatter kept short. Turn it off with
  `LLMChatter.Instance.TacticalChat = 0`.

Any channel can also name its own mode, which overrides both the
default and the instance rule:

```ini
LLMChatter.ChatterMode = roleplay          # in-character world
LLMChatter.ChatterMode.Party = normal      # ...but plain party chat
LLMChatter.ChatterMode.Raid = normal       # ...and plain raid chat
```

The channels are `General`, `Guild`, `Say` (also used for `/yell`),
`Party`, `Raid`, and `Battleground`. All ship empty, meaning "inherit
`LLMChatter.ChatterMode`", so an existing config behaves exactly as it
did before. Actual NPCs stay in character in every mode.

### The Player Glossary

Normal-mode bots speak as people playing WoW, and people playing WoW
talk in shorthand. `PLAYER_JARGON` in
[`tools/chatter_constants.py`](tools/chatter_constants.py) holds that
vocabulary — pulls and threat, roles, specs and gear, trade chat,
loot rules, guild talk, PvP, city abbreviations, and the out-of-game
realities of lag and AFK breaks — bucketed by the situation that makes
each term natural.

Each prompt draws a short rotating sample from the buckets that fit the
channel, so a battleground callout reaches for `FC` and `inc` while zone
chat reaches for `WTS`, `PST`, and `SW`. The sample is a reference, not
a checklist: it is attached to fewer than half of messages on purpose,
and the prompt tells the model to work in at most one or two terms and
skip them entirely when plain words read better. A bot that reaches for
jargon in every line reads like a glossary, not a person.

Two boundaries are deliberate:

* **Roleplay mode never sees any of it.** A character living in Azeroth
  has no word for "off-spec".
* **WotLK 3.3.5a only.** Later-expansion vocabulary — Mythic+ keystones,
  LFR, transmog, the Great Vault — is absent and covered by a test. A bot
  asking for a key link in Naxxramas breaks immersion harder than plain
  English would.

To add terms, drop them into the right bucket as `"term (plain
meaning)"`. The meaning is there so the model uses the term correctly;
it is not an instruction to spell the abbreviation out.

### Known Limitations
- **Ollama / open-source models**: Local inference needs fast hardware and
  strong instruction following. Small or reasoning-heavy models can be slow,
  return malformed JSON, or spend the output budget before producing visible
  chat. Prefer an instruct/tool-capable 8B-or-larger model and enable
  `LLMChatter.Ollama.DisableThinking` for compatible thinking models.
- Ollama cloud models add routing overhead compared to the direct DeepSeek API

## Setup

### Important: Disable Default Bot Chat

This module **replaces** built-in playerbot chat. Add to `playerbots.conf`:

```ini
AiPlayerbot.EnableBroadcasts = 0
AiPlayerbot.RandomBotTalk = 0
AiPlayerbot.RandomBotEmote = 0
AiPlayerbot.RandomBotSuggestDungeons = 0
AiPlayerbot.EnableGreet = 0
AiPlayerbot.GuildFeedback = 0
AiPlayerbot.RandomBotSayWithoutMaster = 0
```

### Docker

**1. Configure**

Copy `modules/mod-llm-chatter/conf/mod_llm_chatter.conf.dist` to `env/dist/etc/modules/` and rename it to `mod_llm_chatter.conf`. Open it in a text editor and set at minimum:
- `LLMChatter.Provider`,  choose `deepseek` or `ollama`
- `LLMChatter.Model`, using the exact ID format shown in
  [Provider and Model Setup](#provider-and-model-setup)
- the matching provider API key, `LLMChatter.DeepSeek.ApiKey` when using DeepSeek (not needed for Ollama)

**2. Add bridge to docker-compose.override.yml**
```yaml
services:
  ac-llm-chatter-bridge:
    container_name: ac-llm-chatter-bridge
    image: python:3.11-slim
    networks:
      - ac-network
    working_dir: /app
    environment:
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
    command: >
      bash -c "
        pip install --quiet -r /app/requirements.txt &&
        python llm_chatter_bridge.py --config /config/mod_llm_chatter.conf
      "
    volumes:
      - ./modules/mod-llm-chatter/tools:/app:ro
      - ./env/dist/etc/modules:/config:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      ac-database:
        condition: service_healthy
    profiles: [dev]
```

**3. Initialize character tables**

The chatter bridge does not create database tables. AzerothCore imports
the module SQL automatically when worldserver or `dbimport` runs, but
the bridge can fail on a fresh database if it starts first.

On a fresh install, either start worldserver once before starting the
bridge, or import the base character schema manually after the database
container is running:

```bash
docker exec -i ac-database mysql -uroot -ppassword acore_characters < \
  modules/mod-llm-chatter/data/sql/characters/base/00000000_llm_chatter_tables.sql
```

**4. Load talent data (optional)**

Populates talent and spell lookup tables that give the LLM richer context
about each bot's specialization. Worldserver treats `talenttab_dbc` rows as
runtime DBC overrides, so the included masks and ordering match the WotLK
3.3.5a client DBC.

```bash
docker exec -i ac-database mysql -uroot -ppassword acore_world < \
  modules/mod-llm-chatter/data/sql/world/base/llm_chatter_talent_dbc.sql
```

**5. Start**
```bash
docker compose --profile dev up -d
```

### Non-Docker

**1. Build**,  place this repo under `modules/` and rebuild AzerothCore.

**2. Configure**

Copy `conf/mod_llm_chatter.conf.dist` to your server's config directory (typically `etc/modules/`) and rename it to `mod_llm_chatter.conf`. Open it in a text editor and set at minimum:
- `LLMChatter.Provider`,  choose `deepseek` or `ollama`
- `LLMChatter.Model`, using the exact ID format shown in
  [Provider and Model Setup](#provider-and-model-setup)
- the matching provider API key, `LLMChatter.DeepSeek.ApiKey` when using DeepSeek (not needed for Ollama)

**3. Initialize character tables**

The chatter bridge does not create database tables. AzerothCore imports
the module SQL automatically when worldserver or `dbimport` runs, but
the bridge can fail on a fresh database if it starts first.

On a fresh install, either start worldserver once before starting the
bridge, or import the base character schema manually:

```bash
mysql -uroot -ppassword acore_characters < \
  data/sql/characters/base/00000000_llm_chatter_tables.sql
```

**4. Start the bridge**
```bash
cd tools/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python llm_chatter_bridge.py --config /path/to/mod_llm_chatter.conf
```

**5. Load talent data (optional)**

Populates talent and spell lookup tables that give the LLM richer context
about each bot's specialization. Worldserver treats `talenttab_dbc` rows as
runtime DBC overrides, so the included masks and ordering match the WotLK
3.3.5a client DBC.

```bash
mysql -uroot -ppassword acore_world < \
  data/sql/world/base/llm_chatter_talent_dbc.sql
```

**6. Start or keep worldserver running.**

## Upgrading

> **First-time installing the module? Skip this section.**
> The base schema in
> `data/sql/characters/base/00000000_llm_chatter_tables.sql`
> already contains everything every migration adds. Fresh installs do
> **not** need the dated migration files below after the base schema has
> been applied. That can happen automatically through worldserver or
> `dbimport`, or manually with the setup command above if the bridge is
> started before worldserver.

**Existing installs** must apply migration scripts manually
when updating to a newer version. Migrations live under
`data/sql/*/updates/` and are named by date.

### Required spell override repair

Installations that loaded the optional talent data before April 9, 2026
must apply the following world-database migration. Older versions inserted
incomplete `spell_dbc` overrides that could cause spell-script validation
warnings and hide real client spell effects. The migration only removes
rows that still match that legacy placeholder shape and is safe to rerun.

```bash
# Docker
docker exec -i ac-database mysql -uroot -ppassword acore_world < \
  modules/mod-llm-chatter/data/sql/world/updates/20260913_remove_legacy_spell_dbc_placeholders.sql

# Non-Docker
mysql -uroot -ppassword acore_world < \
  data/sql/world/updates/20260913_remove_legacy_spell_dbc_placeholders.sql
```

Restart worldserver after applying this repair so it reloads the restored
client DBC records. Fresh installations using the current talent-data SQL
do not create the incomplete rows and do not need this repair.

### Character-database migrations

Apply the relevant character migrations when upgrading:

```bash
# Docker

Migrations are idempotent — safe to run on an already
up-to-date database. Run them in date order after each
`git pull` that includes new migration files.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No chatter appearing | Check `Enable = 1`, API key set, bots in zone with player |
| Group chat not working | Set `GroupChatter.Enable = 1`, must have bots in party |
| BG chatter not working | Set `BGChatter.Enable = 1`, join WSG/AB/EY with bots |
| Raid chatter not working | Set `RaidChatter.Enable = 1`, raid group in supported instance |
| Too much / too little chatter | Tune chance and cooldown settings in config |
| Ollama slow responses | Try a smaller model or use a cloud provider |
| Cloud replies feel slow | Run the latency probe below — a thinking model is the usual cause |

### Bots won't chat? Check the health report

You don't need to run anything. Every time the bridge starts, it
runs a built-in health check and prints a simple **PASS / FAIL**
report. Just look at the bridge's startup output:

- **Docker:** the bridge window, or run `docker logs ac-llm-chatter-bridge`
- **Non-Docker:** the bridge's console output

A copy of the report is also saved to
`modules/mod-llm-chatter/logs/healthcheck.log`, so you can open it
like a normal text file.

If something is misconfigured, the report names the problem in plain
language and tells you how to fix it. It checks:

- the config file loads and the module is enabled
- the database connection — wrong username/password, unreachable
  host, or wrong database name
- the required tables exist
- the LLM provider and API key — missing key, a leftover example
  placeholder, an invalid key, or an unreachable local model

A failing check looks like this:

```
[FAIL] LLM provider config
      The deepseek API key is still the example placeholder.
      -> Replace the placeholder in LLMChatter.DeepSeek.ApiKey with your real key.
```

Fix the items marked `[FAIL]`, restart the bridge, and check that
every line now shows `[PASS]`. If they all pass and bots still don't
talk, see the table above.

> The check runs automatically by default. It can be turned off with
> `LLMChatter.HealthCheck.Enable = 0`, and the live LLM test call can
> be disabled with `LLMChatter.HealthCheck.LLMProbe = 0`.

### Chatter feels slow? Measure it

Slow replies are almost always the model thinking before it
answers. DeepSeek enables thinking by default, so the bridge turns
it off explicitly — but nothing in the normal request path checks
whether the provider honoured that, and a model that thinks anyway
looks exactly like a model that is merely slow.

The latency probe tells them apart. It sends chatter-sized prompts
through the same request builder the bridge uses and reports the
wall-clock time plus the reasoning tokens spent:

**Docker:**

```bash
docker exec ac-llm-chatter-bridge python /app/chatter_latency_probe.py --config /config/mod_llm_chatter.conf --compare
```

**Non-Docker:**

```bash
python tools/chatter_latency_probe.py --config <path/to/mod_llm_chatter.conf> --compare
```

`--compare` also times the provider's own default and a
thinking-on request, so you can see what the setting is worth. Read
the result like this:

- **Reasoning tokens above zero on the `production` line** — the
  model is thinking despite being told not to. Switch
  `LLMChatter.Model` to a non-thinking model.
- **Reasoning tokens at zero, but still slow** — that is the
  provider's real speed for this model. Lower
  `LLMChatter.MaxTokens`, or move to a faster model.
- **The `production` and `no-thinking-param` medians match** — the
  thinking flags are not changing anything on this model.

If you route features to different providers, `--all-routes`
measures each one against the endpoint the bridge would really use,
and `--feature guild` measures just that one:

```bash
python tools/chatter_latency_probe.py --config <path/to/mod_llm_chatter.conf> --all-routes
```

This is also the quickest way to confirm a route works at all: a
route that reaches the wrong endpoint fails here immediately, rather
than during a raid.

**Check logs:** `docker logs ac-llm-chatter-bridge --since 5m`
