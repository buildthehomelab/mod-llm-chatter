# mod-llm-chatter - Logic Documentation

This document describes the current runtime logic of `mod-llm-chatter`.

It is meant to answer two practical questions:

1. What does the module do at runtime?
2. Where does that logic live?


---

## 1. Overview

`mod-llm-chatter` creates ambient and reactive bot chat for AzerothCore.
It combines C++ event capture and in-game delivery with a Python bridge
that builds prompts, calls an LLM, and writes final messages back to the
database.

High-level behavior:

- ambient General-channel chatter in the open world
- ambient Guild statements and two- or three-bot conversations
- player-driven Guild replies with per-login rolling session memory
- reactive party chatter for grouped bots
- General-channel reactions to real player chat
- world event chatter for weather, holidays, transports, and nearby
  points of interest
- battleground chatter for flag, node, PvP, milestone, and related BG
  events
- PvE raid chatter for boss encounters, lifted group features, and
  idle morale
- real-time subzone lore tracking with ~3,000 subzone descriptions
  injected into prompts
- proximity chatter: ambient `/say` conversations between bots, NPCs,
  and the player as they move through the world, with NPC speech bubbles
  and natural player reply detection
- in-game addon bridge: `.llmc` command lets the Chatter Companion addon
  read and write bot personality traits and tone from the game UI
- MultiBot-Chatless bridge coexistence: hidden `MBOT` addon traffic is
  ignored by chatter logging and left for `mod-multibot-bridge` by
  default, so chatter does not block the addon's chatless
  communication. An optional fallback handler remains available for
  installs without the bridge

---

## 2. Runtime Pipeline

### C++ side

The C++ module:

- detects hooks and world events
- inserts queue rows into MySQL
- runs the message delivery tick
- plays party text emotes when appropriate

### Python side

The Python bridge:

- polls `llm_chatter_events` and `llm_chatter_queue`
- routes by event type
- builds prompt context
- calls the configured LLM provider
- writes final output rows to `llm_chatter_messages`

### Delivery

After Python writes the message rows, C++ delivers them in game on the
world tick.

Party channel may play text emotes.
General, Guild, raid, and battleground delivery do not play text
emotes.

---

## 2b. Queueing, Timing, and the Main Bridge Loop

The runtime is split into three DB-backed stages, and the Python bridge
does not process all of them inline in one thread.

### The three stages

1. **Request/event creation**
   - C++ inserts either:
     - legacy ambient requests into `llm_chatter_queue`
     - reactive/event work into `llm_chatter_events`
2. **Bridge processing**
   - Python claims ready work, builds prompts, calls the LLM, and writes
     final chat rows to `llm_chatter_messages`
3. **In-game delivery**
   - C++ world tick delivers ready rows from `llm_chatter_messages`

### What the main bridge loop actually does

`llm_chatter_bridge.py` runs one long-lived coordinator loop. That loop:

- harvests completed futures
- runs periodic cleanup
- claims ready events from `llm_chatter_events`
- submits them to worker threads
- periodically submits timer-like jobs such as:
  - legacy ambient request processing
  - idle group chatter checks
  - bot-question checks
  - pre-cache refills
- sleeps for `LLMChatter.Bridge.PollIntervalSeconds` between iterations

So the bridge is:

- one coordinator loop
- a `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- multiple worker tasks running in parallel

It is **not** "one loop that processes every message end to end by
itself."

### Event workers vs timer-style jobs

Reactive/event rows from `llm_chatter_events` are claimed in priority
order and then processed in worker threads via `process_single_event()`.

Timer-style jobs are separate worker submissions launched only when
their interval elapses:

- idle chatter
- bot questions
- pre-cache refill
- legacy ambient request processing

These jobs share the same executor, but they are not fetched from the
event table.

### Group serialization

The bridge allows parallel processing overall, but events with the same
`group_id` are wrapped in a per-group lock. That means one party's work
is serialized even while different groups can process concurrently.

Session 69 refined this by separating urgent/high and filler lock lanes
for the same group so queued filler work is less likely to block queued
urgent work.

### Event queue ordering

`llm_chatter_events` is fetched with:

- `status = 'pending'`
- `react_after <= NOW()` or null
- `expires_at > NOW()` or null
- `ORDER BY priority DESC, created_at ASC`

So event priority matters at claim time.

### Legacy ambient queue ordering

`llm_chatter_queue` is the older ambient queue. It is processed FIFO:

- `ORDER BY created_at ASC`

`LLMChatter.MaxPendingRequests` currently gates this queue only.

### Final message delivery ordering

Python inserts final rows into `llm_chatter_messages` with:

- `deliver_at = NOW() + delay_seconds`

C++ delivery now has two modes:

- fallback mode:
  - `WHERE delivered = 0 AND deliver_at <= NOW()`
  - `ORDER BY deliver_at ASC LIMIT 1`
- priority mode, when
  `LLMChatter.PrioritySystem.Enable = 1` and
  `LLMChatter.PrioritySystem.DeliveryOrderEnable = 1`:
  - ready rows are `LEFT JOIN`ed back to `llm_chatter_events`
  - ordered by `COALESCE(e.priority, 0) DESC, m.deliver_at ASC`

So urgent event-backed rows can now overtake filler rows at final
delivery time, while ambient rows with `event_id = NULL` stay lowest
priority.

### Party chat pacing gate

Party chat has an additional per-group pacing layer to avoid several
LLM-generated lines landing in the chat window at nearly the same time.

The gate uses `llm_party_chat_pacing`:

- Python inserts party messages with `group_id`, `delivery_policy`, and
  `delivery_reason`, then reserves the next visible slot for that group.
- Filler work such as idle chatter, bot questions, nearby-object
  comments and observer comments can defer
  before the LLM call when the group's party chat is already busy.
- Responsive and contextual messages are delayed only enough to avoid
  overlap. Urgent and bypass-style feedback can remain immediate.
- C++ delivery refreshes the pacing row when a party line is actually
  sent, so late delivery does not cause following lines to bunch up.
- C++ instant paths that do not use `llm_chatter_messages`, including
  pre-cached combat/state/spell reactions and farewell packets, record
  gate activity after sending. They are not delayed, but they still
  suppress immediate filler spam behind them.

### Current priority behavior and remaining limits

The system now has real priority behavior across multiple stages, but it
is still not a single perfect global scheduler across:

- legacy ambient requests
- event workers
- background timer jobs
- final delivery

What Session 69 added:

- centralized C++ event priority bands
- config-backed react ranges per tier
- bridge urgent-backlog yield for filler jobs
- priority-aware final delivery ordering
- bridge safety mode that suppresses filler first under overload

Also, `GlobalMessageCap` and `TransportBypassGlobalCap` are currently
legacy config values. They are no longer the intended main control path;
the active design direction is priority tiers plus provider-safety
suppression.

### Timing layers

There are two separate delays that are easy to confuse:

- **Reaction delay**: C++ sets `react_after` when queueing an event
- **Delivery delay**: Python sets `deliver_at` when writing the final
  message row

Most delivery delays use `calculate_dynamic_delay()` in
`chatter_shared.py`:

- `responsive=True` for player-directed replies
- ambient/group conversation paths can also include reading time from
  `prev_message_length`

This separation is important if you plan to redesign priorities, because
priority currently influences claim order more than final speak order.

## 3. C++ File Ownership

### `src/LLMChatterScript.cpp`

Registration coordinator only. Calls:

- `AddLLMChatterWorldScripts()`
- `AddLLMChatterGroupScripts()`
- `AddLLMChatterPlayerScripts()`
- `AddLLMChatterBGScripts()`
- `AddLLMChatterRaidScripts()`

### `src/LLMChatterShared.cpp`

Owns shared helpers used across domains:

The shared timing logic now uses table-driven priority and reaction-delay
registries instead of a single long conditional block.

- `EscapeString()`
- `JsonEscape()`
- `GetZoneName()`
- `GetChatterClassName()`
- `GetRaceName()`
- `BuildBotIdentityFields()` — emits `bot_name`, `bot_class`,
  `bot_race`, `bot_gender`, `bot_level` into event JSON
- `QueueChatterEvent()`
- `BuildBotStateJson()`
- `AppendRaidContext()`
- `GroupHasBots()`
- `CanSpeakInGeneralChannel()`
- `GetTextEmoteName()` — reverse emote ID-to-name lookup (170+ entries)
- `SendUnitTextEmote(Unit*, uint32, const std::string&)` — unified text emote
  sender for any unit (bot or creature); both `SendBotTextEmote` overloads
  delegate to this; `SendCreatureTextEmote` was removed in favour of this
  single shared implementation
- `IsEventOnCooldown()` / `SetEventCooldown()` — shared event cooldown
  helper (cache-first, DB fallback) used by world, ambient, and nearby
- shared link conversion helpers
- shared emote and delivery helpers

Critical contract:

- direct callers of `QueueChatterEvent()` must provide `extraData` that
  is already SQL-safe for insertion into a single-quoted SQL string
- all event hooks include `bot_gender` (and `player_gender` where
  applicable) in the `extra_data` JSON so Python prompt builders can
  use correct pronouns via `resolve_gender()`

### `src/LLMChatterWorld.cpp`

Owns world and environment behavior:

- `LLMChatterWorldScript`
- `LLMChatterGameEventScript`
- `LLMChatterALEScript`
- delivery tick coordination only
- ambient and nearby delegation only
- transport polling and route announcements
- world-private `QueueEvent()`

### `src/LLMChatterDelivery.cpp`

Owns outbound delivery behavior:

- `DeliverPendingMessagesImpl()`
- DB polling for ready `llm_chatter_messages` rows
- pre-send facing selection
- party, raid, BG, yell, and General delivery paths
- post-send delivery and retry updates

### `src/LLMChatterAmbient.cpp`

Owns ambient world/event behavior:

- day/night transitions
- holiday start/stop routing
- weather state and transition handling
- ambient zone selection and faction choice
- ambient chatter queue writes

### `src/LLMChatterNearby.cpp`

Owns nearby scan behavior:

- nearby-object and nearby-creature scanning
- POI helper structs and interest scoring
- nearby-local cooldown state
- direct nearby event queue insertion

### `src/LLMChatterGroupInternal.h`

Shared internal header for the group domain TUs:

- struct definitions: `GroupJoinEntry`, `GroupJoinBatch`,
  `QuestAcceptEntry`, `QuestAcceptBatch`
- extern declarations for all shared cooldown maps, batch containers,
  mutexes, emote cooldowns, named boss cache
- `EmoteTargetType` enum
- shared helper and domain entry-point declarations

### `src/LLMChatterGroup.cpp`

Retains core group glue:

- shared state variable definitions
- shared helpers: `GroupHasRealPlayer`, `GetRandomBotInGroup`,
  `CountBotsInGroup`, `IsLikelyPlayerbotControlCommand`, pre-cache
  helpers
- MultiBot-Chatless bridge coexistence. By default,
  `mod-multibot-bridge` owns `MBOT` packets and mod-llm-chatter only
  suppresses its own ignored-addon debug log for that hidden protocol.
  It does not consume or block the addon's communication in this mode.
  When `LLMChatter.MultiBotCompat.Enable = 1`, a fallback handler
  answers handshake, ping, roster, state, and detail refreshes for
  installs without the bridge
- `CleanupGroupSession()` coordinator
- named-boss cache
 - thin `LLMChatterGroupPlayerScript` wrappers
 - group registration

### `src/LLMChatterGroupCombat.cpp`

Owns the moved group PlayerScript implementation bodies plus the
remaining zone/state helpers:

- kill, death, loot, combat, chat, level, quest objectives, quest
  complete, achievement, spell, resurrect, corpse run, dungeon entry,
  and emote dispatch hook implementations
- `HandleGroupPlayerUpdateZone()`
- `CheckGroupCombatState()`
- file-local `QueueStateCallout()`

### `src/LLMChatterGroupJoin.cpp`

Owns join batching and GroupScript:

- `QueueBotGreetingEvent()`
- `EnsureGroupJoinQueued()`
- `FlushGroupJoinBatches()`
- `LLMChatterGroupScript` (GroupScript: `OnAddMember`, `OnRemoveMember`
  with farewell, `OnDisband`)

### `src/LLMChatterGroupEmote.cpp`

Owns emote reaction system:

- `DelayedMirrorEmoteEvent`, `DelayedCreatureMirrorEmoteEvent`
- emote static data: mirror map, denylist, combat callouts, contagious
  set
- `HandleEmoteAtGroupBot()`, `HandleEmoteAtCreature()`,
  `HandleEmoteObserver()`
- `EvictEmoteCooldowns()`

### `src/LLMChatterGroupQuest.cpp`

Owns quest accept batching and CreatureScript:

- `FlushQuestAcceptBatches()`
- `LLMChatterCreatureScript` (`CanCreatureQuestAccept` with
  debounce/immediate paths)

### `src/LLMChatterPlayer.cpp`

Owns player General-channel behavior:

- `LLMChatterPlayerScript`
- `EnsureBotInGeneralChannel()`
- General chat cooldowns
- `OnPlayerCanUseChat(..., Channel*)`
- writes to `llm_general_chat_history`

### `src/LLMChatterBG.cpp`

Owns battleground-specific hooks and BG queue helpers.

## 4. Current Python File Ownership

### Bridge and orchestration

- `tools/llm_chatter_bridge.py`
- `tools/chatter_event_registry.py`
- `tools/chatter_ambient.py`

### Group domain

- `tools/chatter_group.py`
- `tools/chatter_group_handlers.py`
- `tools/chatter_handler_pipeline.py`
- `tools/chatter_group_prompts.py`
- `tools/chatter_group_state.py`

### Routing and handler pipeline

The bridge no longer relies only on a manually maintained in-file
handler map.

- `chatter_event_registry.py` is now the Python-side event registry for
  live event types, handler module/function resolution, producer notes,
  and payload-field documentation
- `build_handler_map()` dynamically imports handlers from that registry
  during bridge startup
- `player_general_msg` still uses a local adapter path because its
  function signature differs from the group-event handlers
- `chatter_handler_pipeline.py` centralizes the shared setup/teardown
  path used by most single-reaction `bot_group_*` handlers via
  `run_group_handler()`

### General/shared support

- `tools/chatter_general.py`
- `tools/chatter_group_general_reaction.py` - queues and handles
  `bot_group_general_reaction` events so grouped bots can react in party
  chat to bot-authored General lines
- `tools/chatter_shared.py`
- `tools/chatter_text.py`
- `tools/chatter_llm.py` — LLM call dispatch, system prompt splitting
- `tools/chatter_db.py`
- `tools/chatter_links.py`
- `tools/chatter_events.py`
- `tools/chatter_prompts.py`

## 4b. Config Pipeline

C++ and Python read configuration independently. There is no C++ →
Python config relay.

- **C++ config**: `LLMChatterConfig.cpp` loads values from
  `mod_llm_chatter.conf` via the AzerothCore `sConfigMgr` API. These
  are values that C++ needs at runtime (cooldowns, chances for C++
  hooks, thresholds). Stored as member variables in `LLMChatterConfig`.

- **Python config**: `parse_config()` in `chatter_shared.py` reads the
  same `.conf` file directly from disk on bridge startup. Values are
  stored in a Python dict and accessed via `config.get('Key', default)`.
  Python-only config keys (e.g., `BotQuestionChance`, `IdleChance`,
  `ActionChance`, `ConversationBias`) are never loaded by C++ — they
  exist only in the `.conf` file and are read only by Python.

When adding a new Python-only config key:
1. Add the key + comment to `conf/mod_llm_chatter.conf.dist`
2. Add the key to your active server config file
3. Read it in Python via `config.get('LLMChatter.GroupChatter.KeyName', default)`
4. No C++ changes needed

Some narrow server-side compatibility switches may be read directly
through `sConfigMgr` instead of being stored on `LLMChatterConfig`.
`LLMChatter.MultiBotCompat.Enable` follows that shape.

---

## 5. Supported Providers

Configured through:

- `LLMChatter.Provider`
- `LLMChatter.Model`

Supported providers:

- DeepSeek
- Ollama

Both speak the OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API, so the bridge has
a single request path and a single client factory
(`chatter_llm.build_llm_client()`).

If a provider explicitly rejects `temperature`, `reasoning_effort`,
`max_tokens`, or `max_completion_tokens`, the bridge adjusts that one
parameter, retries the rejected request, and caches the successful shape
for that provider/model until restart. This recovery is limited to HTTP 400
or 422 errors and prefers the provider's structured parameter/code fields;
other failures are not hidden or retried by this compatibility path.

Generic provider error types such as `invalid_request_error` are not treated
as parameter rejection codes by themselves.

DeepSeek is the default provider. Thinking mode is enabled by default on
the DeepSeek side, so the bridge always states the choice explicitly and
reads an empty `DeepSeek.ReasoningEffort` as `none`:

```ini
LLMChatter.Provider = deepseek
LLMChatter.Model = deepseek-flash
LLMChatter.DeepSeek.ApiKey = sk-xxxxx
LLMChatter.DeepSeek.ReasoningEffort = none
```

Any effort other than `none` turns thinking on. DeepSeek accepts `none`,
`low`, `high`, and `max` (`minimal` maps to low; `medium` and `xhigh` map
to high), ignores `temperature` while thinking, and spends thinking
tokens from the output budget, so raise the multiplier if replies come
back empty or truncated:

```ini
LLMChatter.Provider = deepseek
LLMChatter.Model = deepseek-v4-pro
LLMChatter.DeepSeek.ReasoningEffort = high
LLMChatter.DeepSeek.MaxTokensMultiplier = 5
```

```ini
LLMChatter.Provider = ollama
LLMChatter.Model = qwen3:4b
```

Ollama context size must be configured on the Ollama server with
`OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH` or `PARAMETER num_ctx` in a Modelfile; the
OpenAI-compatible endpoint does not accept it per request. Verify the loaded
context with `ollama ps`. `Ollama.DisableThinking = 1` sends
`reasoning_effort = none` and retains `/no_think` as a model fallback.

### System prompt support

`call_llm()` in `chatter_llm.py` supports automatic system/user
prompt splitting. Prompt builders can return a `PromptParts` object
(from `chatter_shared.py`) instead of a plain string. `PromptParts`
wraps a single prompt string, and `_split_prompt()` in
`chatter_llm.py` detects the boundary between format/rules
instructions and scene-specific content, splitting them into a
system message and a user message.

Provider behavior:

- **DeepSeek**: system content is sent as a `{"role": "system", ...}`
  message prepended to the messages array. The `thinking` object is
  always sent explicitly because DeepSeek enables it by default;
  temperature is omitted while thinking is on, and the output budget
  receives a configurable multiplier
- **Ollama**: same system-role message shape; context is configured on the
  Ollama server, and thinking can be disabled through the compatibility
  parameter plus a `/no_think` fallback

The shared `llm_compat.py` layer owns cross-model parameter capability
selection and the narrow unsupported-parameter recovery path. Provider
extensions remain in `chatter_llm.py`, keeping model quirks out of the
feature and prompt modules.

When a plain string is passed to `call_llm()` instead of
`PromptParts`, the entire prompt is sent as a single user message
(backward-compatible behavior).

### Key helpers in `chatter_llm.py`

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `_split_prompt()` | Detects `PromptParts` and splits into system + user content |
| `_build_chat_messages()` | Assembles the provider-specific messages array |
| `_ollama_user_msg()` | Formats the user message for Ollama's chat API |
| `_apply_deepseek_options()` | Applies DeepSeek thinking mode and drops temperature while thinking |
| `build_llm_client()` | Single OpenAI-compatible client factory for both providers |
| `resolve_provider()` | Normalises `LLMChatter.Provider`, defaulting to DeepSeek |
| `build_compatible_chat_request()` | Builds the shared production request used by normal calls, quick analysis, and the health probe |
| `llm_compat.build_chat_options()` | Builds the token and sampling parameters, applying any learned overrides |
| `llm_compat.create_chat_completion()` | Retries explicit parameter rejections and caches the learned correction |
| `_sampling_penalties()` | Adds `LLMChatter.FrequencyPenalty` / `PresencePenalty` when set, clamped to -2.0..2.0 and omitted at `0` |

---

## 6. Chatter Modes

Configured through:

- `LLMChatter.ChatterMode` — the server default
- `LLMChatter.ChatterMode.<Channel>` — per-channel override
- `LLMChatter.MixedRoleplayChance`
- `LLMChatter.Roleplay.SuppressInInstances`
- `LLMChatter.Instance.TacticalChat`

Configured modes:

- `normal`: playerbots speak as people playing WoW
- `roleplay`: in-character, race/class-influenced chat
- `mixed`: rolls between the two, landing on roleplay with probability
  `LLMChatter.MixedRoleplayChance` (default `0.5`), so the server is not
  locked to a single voice. The roll is seeded by the speaker's name
  wherever the caller knows it, so one bot keeps one voice across a
  conversation instead of flipping between messages.

### Resolution

The configured mode is a default, not a verdict. In-character banter
reads well in zone or guild chat and badly in the middle of a dungeon
pull, so `chatter_mode.resolve_chatter_mode(config, channel, ...)`
decides per message. Call it instead of reading `LLMChatter.ChatterMode`
directly anywhere the channel is known. Group code has a thin wrapper,
`chatter_group_state.resolve_group_chatter_mode(db, config, group_id)`,
which looks the group's map up when the caller does not already have it.

Resolution runs in three layers:

1. `LLMChatter.ChatterMode.<Channel>` if set, otherwise the global
   `LLMChatter.ChatterMode`. Channels are `General`, `Guild`, `Say`
   (also used for `/yell`), `Party`, `Raid`, and `Battleground`. All
   ship empty, so an existing config resolves exactly as it did before.
2. `mixed` is rolled into a concrete mode.
3. Inside instanced group content — a dungeon, raid, battleground, or
   arena — on the group task channels (`party`, `raid`,
   `battleground`), roleplay drops to the player voice and the player
   voice tightens to a working register.

Step 3 is skipped for a channel that names its own mode: an admin who
writes `LLMChatter.ChatterMode.Raid = roleplay` means it. Zone, guild,
and `/say` chat are never gated, so an RP server keeps its in-character
world and still gets readable chat during a run.

Instanced content is detected from the server flags an event carries
(`is_raid`, `is_dungeon`, `is_battleground`) and otherwise from the map
ID against `chatter_constants.INSTANCE_MAP_IDS`, which covers every
dungeon, raid, battleground, and arena map in the supported expansions.

### Resolved modes

Resolution yields one of three values, which carry both halves of the
voice contract — who is speaking, and how focused they are:

| Value | Voice | Register |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `normal` | player | social |
| `instanced` | player | working: practical, reactive, short idle chatter |
| `roleplay` | in character | — |

Everything downstream branches on `is_roleplay()`, so `instanced`
behaves exactly like `normal` except where the register matters. Never
compare a resolved mode against `'normal'` directly.

The Python prompt builders use `chatter_mode.py` as the canonical voice
contract. Normal mode applies to playerbot speech in General, Party,
Guild, Battleground, Raid, emote reactions, and
playerbot proximity `/say`. It has a friendly and respectful baseline,
allows polite, quiet, dry, playful, blunt, or occasionally mildly salty
players, and avoids making toxicity or forced gamer slang the default.

Normal prompts treat race, class, level, health, travel, weather, and
locations as character or game state rather than sensations physically
experienced by the speaker. Character backstories and race/class
worldview material are prompt inputs only in roleplay mode. Memory
callbacks in normal mode are framed as remembered gameplay events.

Actual NPCs are the exception: they always remain lore-friendly,
in-world speakers. Proximity chatter can contain NPCs and playerbots in
the same scene, so `chatter_proximity.py` applies the voice rule per
speaker using the existing `is_npc` payload field.

Changing `LLMChatter.ChatterMode` requires a bridge restart. Because
`llm_group_cached_responses` has no mode column, bridge startup removes
only `ready` pre-cache rows and then refills them under the active mode;
used and expired history is left to normal cache hygiene. Under `mixed`
the pre-cache fills with a blend of both voices, which is the intent.

The pre-cache is also per group, not per server, because a group that
zones into a dungeon changes mode without a restart. `chatter_cache.py`
tracks the mode each group's pool was generated under and drops that
group's `ready` rows when it changes, so lines written in one voice are
not delivered in another. The C++ consumer
(`TryConsumeCachedReaction`) is unchanged and has no mode filter, so a
line already queued can still be delivered in the few seconds between
the group zoning and the next refill pass.

## 7. Ambient Open-World Chatter

Ambient chatter is the original module behavior.

### Trigger shape

The system periodically:

1. checks for a valid real player in the open world
2. finds eligible bots in the same zone
3. filters to bots that can actually speak in that zone's General
   channel
4. queues either a one-line statement or a multi-bot conversation

### Eligibility rules

Ambient chatter candidates must:

- be bots
- be in the same zone as the real player
- be in the world and alive
- not be grouped with a real player
- be members of the current General channel

### Message families

Ambient requests can become:

- plain statements
- quest statements
- loot statements
- quest + reward statements
- trade-style statements
- NPC gossip statements/conversations
- bot gossip statements/conversations
- multi-bot conversations

NPC and bot gossip are selected by additive Python-side RNG gates
(`AmbientNpcGossipChance`, `AmbientBotGossipChance`) before the
regular plain/quest/loot/trade/spell mix. If a target cannot be
resolved, the request falls back to plain ambient chatter.

NPC gossip targets are service/social NPCs spawned in the current zone,
with the prompt receiving the NPC name, title/subname, function, creature
kind, and combat-style class when available. Bot gossip targets are
online random bots in the current zone, excluding the speaking bots, with
the prompt receiving name, race, class, and level.

Recently selected gossip targets are held in a per-zone cooldown
(`AmbientGossipTargetCooldownSeconds`) so high test chances do not make
the same NPC or bot become the subject repeatedly.

Prompt generation and runtime logic live mainly in:

- `tools/chatter_ambient.py`
- `tools/chatter_prompts.py`
- `tools/chatter_shared.py`

---

## 8. General-Channel Player Reactions

When a real player speaks in General, the module can queue a
`player_general_msg` event.

### C++ ownership

Current C++ ownership lives in:

- `LLMChatterPlayer.cpp`

Relevant responsibilities:

- `OnPlayerCanUseChat(..., Channel*)`
- bot membership enforcement for General
- per-zone General cooldown handling
- writing/retaining `llm_general_chat_history`

Shared note:

- `CanSpeakInGeneralChannel()` is a shared helper in
  `LLMChatterShared.cpp`; `LLMChatterPlayer.cpp` still owns
  `EnsureBotInGeneralChannel()` and the General-channel hook paths

### Python ownership

Python handling lives in:

- `tools/chatter_general.py`

That path:

- selects responding bot(s)
- builds the player-reaction prompt
- dispatches the reaction through the bridge path

### Shared zone pacing

Automated ambient and world-event General producers share one per-zone
delivery reservation. Multi-line conversations reserve the complete
scheduled sequence before inserting their first row, and the next
automated sequence waits for `GeneralChat.MinZoneGap` after the prior
one's final line. This serializes independently generated ambient,
transport, weather, holiday, and minor-event chatter without reducing
their trigger chances. Direct replies to a player's General message stay
responsive and can interrupt that automated timeline.

### Relevant files

### General-to-party relay

Bot-authored General messages can trigger a party-chat reaction for an
active group in the same zone. The bridge queues
`bot_group_general_reaction` from General-producing Python paths, then
`tools/chatter_group_general_reaction.py` generates either one party
statement or a short 2-3 bot party conversation.

The relay chance is controlled by
`LLMChatter.GroupChatter.GeneralRelayChance` and defaults to 10%. When a
relay fires, the first party line is scheduled for 3-6 seconds after the
General line's planned visible time. The first party line must reference
the General speaker by name. Relay prompts limit every party line to 150
characters. If a provider still returns an overlong line, cleanup prefers a
complete sentence and otherwise shortens at a word boundary instead of
cutting through a word.

## 9. Group Chatter

Group chatter covers party-channel bot reactions when bots are grouped
with a real player.

### Event families

Examples include:

- bot group join
- group player message
- kill and wipe reactions
- death and resurrection reactions
- loot reactions
- spell cast reactions
- quest accept/objective/complete reactions
- zone transitions
- dungeon entry reactions
- nearby-object observations

Note: subzone discovery reactions (`OnPlayerGiveXP` with `XPSOURCE_EXPLORE`) have been
removed. They caused duplicate messages alongside zone transition events. Discovery
context is now covered by zone transition events instead.

### C++ ownership

Current group-side ownership is in:

- `LLMChatterGroup.cpp`
- `LLMChatterGroupCombat.cpp`

Important responsibilities:

- batch accumulation and flush
- per-group cooldown and dedup state
- named-boss cache loading
- combat state callouts
- direct event queue inserts for many `bot_group_*` events

### Python ownership

Current Python group ownership is split across:

- `chatter_group.py`
- `chatter_group_handlers.py`
- `chatter_group_prompts.py`
- `chatter_group_state.py`

### Pre-cache path

Some group reactions use a pre-cache path for faster replies.

That path is separate from live event generation and lives mainly in:

- `tools/chatter_cache.py`
- `tools/chatter_group_prompts.py`

---

## 10. World Events

World-owned C++ logic now spans `LLMChatterWorld.cpp`,
`LLMChatterAmbient.cpp`, and `LLMChatterNearby.cpp`.

### Main categories

- holiday events
- day/night transitions
- weather changes and weather ambient chatter
- transport arrivals triggered by transport objects entering a new
  player-relevant zone, with delivery in General channel
- pending message delivery
- nearby-object / nearby-creature scan events
- proximity chatter scans (delegated to `LLMChatterProximity.cpp`)

### World-to-group boundary

The world layer intentionally calls a narrow group-owned surface:

- `LoadNamedBossCache()`
- `CheckGroupCombatState()`
- `FlushQuestAcceptBatches()`
- `FlushGroupJoinBatches()`

That surface is declared in `LLMChatterGroup.h`.

---

## 11. Nearby Object / Creature Awareness

Bots can notice nearby points of interest and comment on them or start a
short group conversation.

### C++ ownership

Current C++ scanning logic lives in:

- `LLMChatterNearby.cpp`

Specifically:

- `CheckNearbyGameObjects()`
- `NearbyGameObjectCheck`
- `NearbyCreatureCheck`

### Scanned interest types

The scan can surface things like:

- quest NPCs
- rare mobs
- trainers
- vendors
- innkeepers
- flightmasters
- chests
- text / book objects
- spell-focus objects
- critters and beasts

### Suppression

The feature is gated by:

- RNG chance
- per-group per-zone cooldown
- per-bot per-name cooldown
- combat suppression
- mounted/flying/BG suppression

### Python handling

Python handling lives in:

- `chatter_group_handlers.py`
- `chatter_group_prompts.py`

That path can produce either:

- a single reaction
- a short nearby-object conversation

---

## 12. Weather, Transport, and Holiday Behavior

### Weather

The world layer tracks current weather state per zone and queues:

- `weather_change`
- `weather_ambient`

Python can then naturally reference weather in prompts and event
reactions.

### Transport

Transport arrivals are world-owned C++ events with verified bot GUIDs in
`extra_data` so Python only uses bots that can actually speak in the
zone channel.

Current transport logic is:

1. poll live transport objects on the world timer
2. detect an actual zone/map transition per live transport GUID
3. ignore the transition unless the destination zone currently contains
   a real player
4. choose eligible General-channel bots already in that zone
5. write those GUIDs into `verified_bots`
6. suppress redispatch for the same transport entry until the transport
   cooldown window expires

This is intentionally an early-warning model. The message should appear
while the boat or zeppelin is approaching, not only after it has fully
docked.

### Holidays

Holiday chatter is also world-owned and queues zone/city-specific event
rows instead of speaking directly.

---

## 13. Battleground Chatter

Battleground-specific logic is self-contained in its own files.

### C++ ownership

- `LLMChatterBG.cpp`
- `LLMChatterBG.h`

### Python ownership

- `chatter_battlegrounds.py`
- `chatter_bg_prompts.py`
- `chatter_raid_base.py`

### Typical BG events

- match start / end
- flag pickup / drop / capture / return
- node assault / capture
- PvP kill
- score milestones
- arrival greetings
- BG idle chatter

### Current BG routing policy

The older broad "party plus battleground" duplication is no longer the
intended behavior.

BG-wide only:

- match start
- match end
- flag pickup / drop / capture / return

Subgroup/party only:

- PvP kills
- node assault / capture chatter
- score milestones
- spell/state chatter
- idle chatter
- flag-carrier self-messages

This keeps strategic objective callouts visible to the whole team while
reducing duplicated tactical chatter.

### BG brevity tuning

BG prompts now use a dedicated token cap plus stricter brevity
instructions so chatter stays short and tactical.

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BGChatter.MaxTokens` | 32 | Max token cap for BG prompt paths |

### Flag-carrier context persistence

BG prompts continue to receive both:

- `friendly_flag_carrier`
- `enemy_flag_carrier`

from `AppendBGContext()` in `LLMChatterBG.cpp`.

That means if a real player is carrying the enemy flag, later BG prompt
requests continue to know that until the flag is dropped, returned, or
captured.

---

## 13a. PvE Raid Chatter

Raid chatter extends group features into raid instances and adds
raid-specific events.

### Phase 1 (Session 70b): Boss Encounters

C++ `LLMChatterRaid.cpp` owns raid-specific boss hooks:

- `raid_boss_pull` — fires on boss engage
- `raid_boss_kill` — fires on boss death
- `raid_boss_wipe` — fires on raid wipe during boss encounter

Python handling lives in:

- `chatter_raids.py` — event handlers
- `chatter_raid_prompts.py` — prompt builders with instance/wing context

### Phase 2 (Session 71): Lifted Guards and Morale

Five suppression guards were changed from `IsRaid() || IsBattleground()`
to BG-only, allowing existing group features to fire inside raids:

- **Loot** — epic quality gate (quality >= 4) for raids
- **Nearby objects** — `CheckNearbyGameObjects()` no longer suppressed
- **Quest objectives** — now BG-only guard
- **Quest complete** — now BG-only guard
- **Quest accept batch** — now BG-only guard
- **Join batch** — now BG-only guard

Guards kept suppressed (not suitable for raids):
OnAddMember, OnRemoveMember, LevelUp, Discovery.

Zone transitions are now allowed in raids (Session 94) — subzone
changes fire inside raid instances for wing/area commentary.

New event: `raid_idle_morale` — ambient morale chatter between boss
encounters. `CheckRaidIdleMorale()` in `LLMChatterWorld.cpp` fires on
the world timer. Suppressed during active combat only — dead/ghost
members no longer block morale (Session 94 relaxation).

### Phase 3 (Session 94): Battle Cries, Banter, Idle Boost

**Battle cries**: `_maybe_raid_battle_cry()` in
`chatter_group_handlers.py`. After a party combat reaction in a raid
instance, a different bot shouts a short battle cry in raid chat.
`build_raid_battle_cry_prompt()` produces 5-15 word race/class
flavored war shouts. `BattleCryChance=70`, no cooldown.

**Raid banter**: `build_raid_banter_prompt()` in
`chatter_raid_prompts.py`. Casual between-pulls humor with 10 random
topic hints. `process_raid_idle_morale_event()` picks morale or
banter with 50/50 probability.

**Raid idle boost**: Groups in `RAID_MAP_IDS` (24 Classic/TBC/WotLK
raid map IDs in `chatter_constants.py`) get 2x idle chance and 0.5x
idle cooldown.

**Dead bot awareness**: Idle chatter queries `characters.health` via
LEFT JOIN. Dead bots (`health==0`) get ghost-themed prompt injection
and `[DEAD]` tags in conversation participant lists.

### C++ ownership

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `LLMChatterRaid.cpp` | Boss pull/kill/wipe hooks |
| `LLMChatterWorld.cpp` | `CheckRaidIdleMorale()` |
| `LLMChatterGroup.cpp` | Lifted guards for loot/quest/join-batch |
| `LLMChatterShared.cpp` | `AppendRaidContext()` |
| `LLMChatterConfig.h/.cpp` | 3 morale config keys |

### Python ownership

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `chatter_raids.py` | Boss, morale, and banter event handlers |
| `chatter_raid_prompts.py` | Boss, morale, battle cry, and banter prompts |
| `chatter_group_handlers.py` | `_maybe_raid_battle_cry()` (combat follow-up) |
| `chatter_raid_base.py` | Shared dispatch, subgroup workers |
| `llm_chatter_bridge.py` | Event routing for `raid_*` types |

### Config keys

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MoraleEnable` | 1 | Enable/disable morale chatter |
| `MoraleCooldown` | 300 | Per-group cooldown (seconds) |
| `MoraleChance` | 30 | % chance per check |
| `BattleCryChance` | 70 | % chance for raid battle cry on combat |

### Dispatch model

Raid events use `dual_worker_dispatch()` from `chatter_raid_base.py`
for sub-group (party chat) delivery. Boss cooldown is enforced with
per-group, event-type-specific keys including `groupCounter` for
multi-group instances.

---

## 13b. Player Message Conversations (Multi-Bot Replies)

When a player speaks in party chat, the system can trigger a multi-bot
conversation instead of a single-bot reply. This makes groups feel
more socially dynamic.

Known playerbot control commands are not supposed to reach this
conversation path in current source:

- C++ blocks them before creating `bot_group_player_msg` events,
  including known commands following a valid Playerbot `@target`
  selector and `@command` shorthand
- Python keeps `_is_playerbot_command()` as a fallback skip layer
- ordinary `@BotName` conversation and non-command text after a simple
  selector are preserved; valid aura and aggro selectors are always
  treated as unconditional Playerbot control traffic

### Trigger logic

1. `find_addressed_bot()` in `chatter_shared.py` always fires an LLM
   call (even when name matching succeeds) to assess whether the
   message is `multi_addressed` — i.e., directed at the group rather
   than a single bot. Returns a dict:
   `{"bot": name, "multi_addressed": bool}`.
2. When `multi_addressed=True` and at least 2 bots are available,
   the conversation path is forced (bypasses the RNG gate).
3. Otherwise, the conversation path fires with probability
   `PlayerMsgConversationChance` (default 30%), scaled by bot count
   in the group.

### Multi-addressed detection

The LLM intent check detects plural pronouns ("you guys", "everyone",
"team"), group-directed questions ("what should we do?"), and messages
mentioning multiple bot names. This ensures group-directed speech
gets multi-bot replies without relying on RNG.

### Architecture

Uses Architecture B: a single LLM call returns a JSON array of 2-3
bot replies. `PlayerMsgSecondBotChance` (default 25%) controls whether
a third bot participates beyond the guaranteed two.

### Relevant files

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `chatter_shared.py` | `find_addressed_bot()` with multi-addressed intent |
| `chatter_group_prompts.py` | `build_player_msg_conversation_prompt()` |
| `chatter_group_handlers.py` | `execute_player_msg_conversation()` |
| `chatter_group.py` | Routing: single reply vs conversation |

### Config keys

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PlayerMsgConversationChance` | 30 | % chance of multi-bot reply to player message |
| `PlayerMsgSecondBotChance` | 25 | % chance a 3rd bot joins the conversation |

---

## 13d. Bot-Initiated Questions

Bots can periodically ask the real player creative questions in party
chat, making them feel socially interested in the player rather than
only reacting to events.

### Trigger logic

A Python timer fires every `BotQuestionCheckInterval` (default 30s).
Each tick:

1. Randomly selects one active group
2. Checks cooldown (10 min default) and inflight guard
3. Rolls `BotQuestionChance` (default 1%)
4. Combat suppression: checks for recent combat/kill/spell/death
   events (90s window via JSON_EXTRACT on `llm_chatter_events`)
5. Gets player name from `get_group_player_name()` or join event
   fallback
6. Selects a random bot, builds prompt with player context
7. Validates response ends with `?` (retry once if not)
8. Delivers via `insert_chat_message()` and stores in chat history

### Reply path (existing, no changes)

When the player replies, it fires `bot_group_player_msg`. The
original question is in `llm_group_chat_history`, so the bot's
reply is contextually aware. `PlayerMsgSecondBotChance` (25%)
can trigger a second bot chiming in.

### Config keys

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BotQuestionEnable` | 1 | Enable/disable feature |
| `BotQuestionChance` | 1 | % chance per tick |
| `BotQuestionCooldown` | 600 | Per-group cooldown (seconds) |
| `BotQuestionCheckInterval` | 30 | Timer interval (seconds) |

### Relevant files

| `llm_chatter_bridge.py` | Timer integration in main loop |

---

## 13e. Quest Conversations

Quest events (complete, objectives, accept) can trigger multi-bot
conversations instead of single-statement reactions, controlled by
`QuestConversationChance` (default 30%).

### Decision flow

Each of the 3 single-quest handlers (not `quest_accept_batch`)
checks after marking the event as `processing`:

1. Read `QuestConversationChance` from config
2. Call `get_group_members()` to count bots
3. Gate: `len(members) >= 2 and roll <= chance`
4. If conversation: call `_quest_*_conversation()` helper
5. If statement: existing `run_single_reaction()` path

### Conversation helpers

Two shared functions avoid code triplication:

- `_quest_conversation_pick_bots()` — picks 2-3 bots (reactor
  always included), looks up traits + class/race from DB. Returns
  `(bots, traits_map, bot_guids)` or `None`.
- `_quest_conversation_deliver()` — per-message cleanup
  (`strip_speaker_prefix`, `cleanup_message`, sentence-aware 255-char limit),
  staggered delays via `calculate_dynamic_delay()`, first message
  gets action, stores chat history, marks event completed.

Three orchestration functions call these shared helpers:

- `_quest_complete_conversation()` — includes turn-in NPC lookup
- `_quest_objectives_conversation()` — no NPC, no mood update
- `_quest_accept_conversation()` — includes quest_level/zone_name

### Failure handling

If `call_llm()` fails or `parse_conversation_response()` returns
empty, the helper returns `False` and the handler falls through to
the existing statement path.

### Prompt builders

Three new functions in `chatter_group_prompts.py`:

| Function | Quest context |
|---|---|
| `build_quest_complete_conversation_prompt()` | "TRANSACTION COMPLETE", turn-in NPC, celebration |
| `build_quest_objectives_conversation_prompt()` | "PENDING TURN-IN", relief, readiness |
| `build_quest_accept_conversation_prompt()` | "PREPARATION", quest level, zone, anticipation |

### Config

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `QuestConversationChance` | 30 | % chance per quest event |

### Relevant files

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `chatter_group_handlers.py` | 3 handler mods + 5 helpers |
| `chatter_group_prompts.py` | 3 conversation prompt builders |

---

## 13f. Achievement Event Batching

When multiple bots in the same group earn the same achievement within a
2-second window, the module can collapse those duplicate events into a
single congratulatory reaction.

### Why this exists

Without batching, simultaneous achievement events produce repetitive
party spam and can trigger multiple nearly identical LLM calls.

### Batch logic

`_check_achievement_batch()` in `chatter_group_handlers.py`:

1. queries neighboring `bot_group_achievement` rows for the same
   `group_id` and `achievement_name`
2. considers both `pending` and `processing` rows to avoid ownership
   races
3. assigns the batch to the lowest event ID
4. marks duplicate rows completed
5. returns either:
   - `None` for normal single processing
   - `'already_batched'` for a duplicate row
   - `list[str]` of achiever names for the batch owner

### Relevant files

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `chatter_group_handlers.py` | `_check_achievement_batch()` and achievement event routing |
| `chatter_group_prompts.py` | Group achievement reaction prompt builder |
| `chatter_bg_prompts.py` | BG-side achievement prompt path |

---

## 13g. Talent Context Injection

The bridge can inject talent-based context into prompts so bots sound
more like their build and spec without literally naming talents.

### Shared construction

`build_talent_context()` in `chatter_shared.py`:

1. loads the character's talents from the DB
2. finds the dominant talent tree
3. picks one talent from that tree
4. looks up a short natural-language description from
   `talent_catalog.py`
5. rewrites wording for `speaker` or `target` perspective
6. adds a guardrail telling the LLM not to name the talent directly

### Injection points

Talent context is invoked from:

- group event handlers
- group player-message paths
- General-channel player reactions
- battleground paths through `chatter_raid_base.py` and
  `chatter_battlegrounds.py`

### Config

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TalentInjectionChance` | 40 | % chance a given prompt gets talent context |

### Relevant files

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `chatter_shared.py` | `build_talent_context()` and catalog lookup |
| `chatter_group_handlers.py` | `_maybe_talent_context()` for group events |
| `chatter_group.py` | Talent-aware player/idle/group paths |
| `chatter_general.py` | Talent-aware General prompts |
| `chatter_raid_base.py` | Shared BG/raid talent injection path |
| `talent_catalog.py` | Static talent descriptions |

---

## 13h. Humor Hints and Conversation Pacing

Two later prompt/delivery changes affect how messages feel even though
they did not introduce new event types.

### Humor hints

`_pick_length_hint()` in `chatter_group_prompts.py` now optionally adds
humor guidance through `_maybe_humor_hint()`:

- 40% chance in normal mode
- 35% chance in roleplay mode

This applies across the group prompt builders that use the shared length
hint path. General-channel prompts were also retuned in the same period
to encourage humor more often.

### Ambient conversation pacing

Ambient multi-bot conversations in `chatter_ambient.py` now pass
`prev_message_length` into `calculate_dynamic_delay()`. That gives later
participants a reading delay before they reply to the previous message,
instead of only reacting to their own output length.

---

## 13i. Emote and Action Prompt Gating

### EmoteChance

`LLMChatter.EmoteChance` (default 50) is an RNG gate that controls
whether the emote list is included in prompts. When the roll fails,
the emote instruction block is omitted entirely, saving ~500 tokens
per LLM call. Applied centrally in `append_json_instruction()` and
`append_conversation_json_instruction()` in `chatter_prompts.py`.

If the parser later returns `"emote": null`, insert paths should keep it
null. Python should not synthesize a fallback emote on insert. The
prompt-side `EmoteChance` roll is the source of truth for whether the
LLM was asked for an emote at all.

### ActionChance (dual strategy)

`LLMChatter.ActionChance` (default 10) controls whether action
narrations appear in bot messages. Two strategies:

- **Single statements**: pre-call RNG in `append_json_instruction()`
  decides before the LLM call whether to request an action (saves
  tokens when disabled).
- **Conversations** (General, Proximity, Group idle, Group handlers,
  prompts always request actions (in RP mode).
  Python enforces ActionChance per-message post-parse via
  `strip_conversation_actions()` in `chatter_shared.py`. This avoids
  trusting the LLM to randomize naturally.

In normal mode, actions are suppressed at the prompt level for all
conversation paths (no wasted tokens).

### Action delivery

With `LLMChatter.ActionAsEmote.Enable` (default 1) the action is split
back off the message when it is queued — `split_action_prefix()` in
`chatter_text.py`, called from `insert_chat_message()` — and stored in
the `action` column of `llm_chatter_messages`. Delivery then sends it as
a real text emote through `Unit::TextEmote` immediately before the spoken
line, so the chat log reads:

```
Sylvara scans the treeline, bow already drawn
[Party] [Sylvara]: Fairbreeze burning again?
```

`Unit::TextEmote` is used rather than `Player::TextEmote` so the client
substitutes the bot's name into the `%s` the C++ side prepends. Setting
the option to 0 restores the old inline `*action* text` form. A message
that is nothing but an action is left alone — emitting the emote would
leave an empty chat line behind it. Note that emotes are proximity-based:
on party, raid, guild and General messages only players standing near the
bot see the emote, while the spoken line still reaches the whole channel.

### Config keys

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LLMChatter.EmoteChance` | 50 | % chance emote list is included in prompt (not applied to General channel — emotes are proximity-based) |
| `LLMChatter.ActionChance` | 10 | % chance eligible responses retain/include an action after action gating |
| `LLMChatter.ActionAsEmote.Enable` | 1 | Deliver the action as a text emote before the spoken line instead of inline `*asterisks*` |

---

## 13j. Emote Reaction System

When a player performs a `/emote` (text emote), the
`OnPlayerTextEmote` hook owned by `LLMChatterGroupCombat.cpp`
classifies the target and routes it through the reaction paths below when
eligible. Bot verbal reactions and observer chatter still require grouped
bots. Direct creature verbal and mirror reactions do not.

### Reaction paths

| Path | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| Silent mirror | Player emotes at a group bot | Bot mirrors back a matching emote (e.g. wave to wave, rude to chicken) via `DelayedMirrorEmoteEvent` with natural timing. Per-bot cooldown `_emoteReactCooldowns` |
| Directed verbal reaction | Player emotes at a group bot (after mirror) | Targeted bot queues a `bot_group_emote_reaction` event. Python handler builds an LLM prompt and the bot responds verbally. Per-bot cooldown `_emoteVerbalCooldowns` |
| Directed NPC verbal reaction | Player emotes at an eligible creature | Independently rolls an 80% default chance, then queues `proximity_player_emote`. The addressed NPC always responds first; zero to three compatible NPCs can join. Per-player/NPC cooldown `_directedEmoteCooldowns`; an actually scheduled mirror animation is included in the prompt so speech cannot contradict it |
| Observer comment | Player emotes at a creature, external player, or nobody | A random group bot queues a `bot_group_emote_observer` event. Python handler has the bot make an offhand remark about the emote. Per-group cooldown `_emoteObserverCooldowns` |

Creatures also mirror emotes directed at them via
`DelayedCreatureMirrorEmoteEvent`. Creature verbal and mirror reactions
are independent and are allowed when the player is solo; only the
observer-comment path remains group-gated. A SmartAI text-emote rule or
configured C++ `ReceiveEmote()` owner suppresses all module reactions for
that creature/emote pair except an independent party-bot observer comment,
so scripted speech, animations, and quest logic cannot be duplicated or
contradicted. SmartAI values are matched exactly;
an inert emote value of zero is logged and ignored rather than treated as
a wildcard. The exclusion cache refreshes at startup and on module config
reload. After `.reload smart_scripts`, also run `.reload config` before
testing changed emote ownership.

Directed NPC conversations choose between player-inclusive dialogue and
an NPC aside about the player's actual action. Prompts forbid fabricated
player speech or actions and identify each line's addressee for facing.

### Ownership split for emote bugs

- edit `LLMChatterGroupCombat.cpp` when the bug is about target
  classification, solo-vs-group gating, or which reaction path runs
- edit `LLMChatterGroupEmote.cpp` when the bug is about mirror maps,
  mirror cooldowns, scripted-emote ownership, creature/bot facing, or
  delayed emote execution
- edit `LLMChatterProximity.cpp` or `chatter_proximity.py` when the bug is
  about directed NPC verbal reactions or multi-NPC emote conversations

### Emote coverage

All ~170 social text emotes trigger reactions. A denylist of 4 emotes
is excluded: `BRB`, `MESSAGE`, `MOUNT_SPECIAL`, `STOPATTACK`. Combat
callout emotes (`CHARGE`, `OPENFIRE`, `INCOMING`, `RETREAT`, `FLEE`)
are excluded from observer comments only.

### C++ shared infrastructure

- `GetTextEmoteName(uint32)` in `LLMChatterShared.cpp` — reverse
  emote ID-to-name lookup covering 170+ entries including high-ID range
  381-451
- `SendUnitTextEmote(Unit*, uint32, const std::string&)` — consolidated
  emote packet helper; `SendBotTextEmote` overloads delegate to it
- `s_mirrorEmoteMap` — 30+ entries mapping incoming emote to response
  emote (wave to wave, rude to chicken, etc.)
- `s_contagiousEmotes` — emotes that spread naturally (laugh, cheer,
  dance, etc.)

### Python handlers

| File | Event type | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| `tools/chatter_emote_reaction.py` | `bot_group_emote_reaction` | Directed verbal reaction prompt and delivery |
| `tools/chatter_emote_observer.py` | `bot_group_emote_observer` | Observer comment prompt and delivery |
| `tools/chatter_proximity.py` | `proximity_player_emote` | Directed NPC response or multi-NPC exchange |

| `LLMChatter.EmoteReactions.CustomEnable` | 1 | React to free-text `/e` and `/me` emotes, not just the named ones. The typed text reaches the model as the action; the target comes from the player's current selection, since a custom emote carries none |
| `LLMChatter.EmoteReactions.CustomMaxChars` | 120 | Clamp on typed emote text before it reaches the prompt, cut at a UTF-8 boundary |
| `LLMChatter.EmoteReactions.NPCVerbalReactionChance` | 80 | Independent chance that a directed eligible NPC speaks |
| `LLMChatter.EmoteReactions.NPCVerbalCooldown` | 3 | Seconds per player/NPC verbal-emote cooldown; clamped to 0-3 |
| `LLMChatter.EmoteReactions.CxxScriptExclusionEntries` | seven known entries | C++ `ReceiveEmote()` owners suppress direct NPC reactions |

### Cooldown eviction

`EvictEmoteCooldowns()` runs hourly to clean up stale entries from
the four emote cooldown maps. These maps and the directed proximity-emote
cooldown map are mutex-protected because text-emote hooks may run on map
worker threads.

## 13k. LLM Request Logging

Every `call_llm()` invocation can be recorded to a JSONL log file for
debugging and analysis. This is a Python-only development feature with
no C++ involvement.

### Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tools/chatter_request_logger.py` | Thread-safe JSONL logger |
| `tools/chatter_log_viewer.py` | Zero-dependency stdlib web UI |

### Logger

`chatter_request_logger.py` provides:

- `init_request_logger(config)` — called once at bridge startup; reads
  config, creates the log directory, sets up the global state
- `log_request(label, prompt, response, model, provider, duration_ms)` —
  called from `call_llm()` via lazy import in `finally` block; writes
  one JSONL line per call
- Rotation: when the log file exceeds `MaxSizeMB`, it is renamed to
  `.1.jsonl` and a fresh file begins

Each JSONL record contains:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-18T12:34:56.789",
  "label": "group_join",
  "model": "deepseek-flash",
  "provider": "deepseek",
  "duration_ms": 421,
  "zone_name": "Elwynn Forest",
  "zone_flavor": "A peaceful woodland...",
  "subzone_name": "Goldshire",
  "subzone_lore": "A small hamlet...",
  "speaker_talent": "...",
  "target_talent": "...",
  "system_prompt": "...",
  "prompt": "...",
  "response": "..."
}
```

Metadata fields (zone_name, zone_flavor, subzone_name, subzone_lore,
speaker_talent, target_talent, system_prompt) are only written when
non-empty — absent fields mean the context was not available for that
call. The `system_prompt` field contains the system message content
when the prompt was split via `PromptParts`; absent when the full
prompt was sent as a single user message.

### Labels

Every `call_llm()` call site passes a descriptive `label=` keyword
argument so log entries can be filtered by feature. All 27 call sites
are labelled:

| Label | Source |
|---|---|
| `event_conv` / `event_statement` | `llm_chatter_bridge.py` |
| `ambient_statement` / `ambient_conv` | `chatter_ambient.py` |
| `precache` | `chatter_cache.py` |
| `general_player_msg` / `general_followup` / `general_conv` | `chatter_general.py` |
| `group_join` / `group_welcome` / `group_player_msg` / `group_composition` / `group_idle` / `group_idle_conv` / `group_bot_question` | `chatter_group.py` |
| `group_nearby_obj` / `group_player_msg_conv` / `group_quest_conv` | `chatter_group_handlers.py` |
| `group_farewell` | `chatter_group_state.py` |
| `single_reaction` | `chatter_shared.py` |

### Web viewer

`chatter_log_viewer.py` is a standalone script with no external
dependencies (Python stdlib only). Run it on the host:

```bash
python modules/mod-llm-chatter/tools/chatter_log_viewer.py \
    --log modules/mod-llm-chatter/logs/llm_requests.jsonl \
    --port 5555
```

Then open `http://localhost:5555`.

Features:

- entry list (left panel) + detail view (right panel)
- draggable vertical column divider and horizontal prompt/response divider
- semantic prompt section highlighting with colored left borders:
  IDENTITY, TRAITS, CONTEXT, TASK, RULES, FORMAT, STYLE
- section pill badges in the prompt header
- system prompt pane with copy button, visible when the JSONL entry
  contains a `system_prompt` field
- JSON pretty-print for structured responses
- copy buttons for prompt, response, and system prompt
- filtering by label and text search
- pagination
- auto-refresh every 30s (toggleable)

### Docker bind mount

The log file is written inside the container at `/logs/llm_requests.jsonl`
and mapped to the host at `modules/mod-llm-chatter/logs/` via a bind
mount in `docker-compose.override.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./modules/mod-llm-chatter/logs:/logs:rw
```

**Applying mount changes** requires container recreation, not just restart:

```bash
docker compose --profile dev up -d ac-llm-chatter-bridge
```

### Config keys

All three keys are `[BRIDGE]` scope (Python-only; no server restart needed).

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LLMChatter.RequestLog.Enable` | 1 | Enable/disable logging |
| `LLMChatter.RequestLog.Path` | `/logs/llm_requests.jsonl` | Log file path inside container |
| `LLMChatter.RequestLog.MaxSizeMB` | 50 | Rotation threshold |

## 13c. Responsive Delays

Player-directed replies use faster timing than ambient chatter. The
`calculate_dynamic_delay()` function in `chatter_shared.py` accepts a
`responsive=True` parameter that:

- skips distraction simulation
- uses shorter reaction and typing windows
- enforces a 2-second floor (vs 4 seconds for ambient)
- skips reading time for multi-bot conversation follow-up messages

All player message paths (single reply, conversation, multi-addressed)
use responsive delays. Ambient chatter, idle banter, and world events
continue to use standard timing.

---

## 13l. Shared `chatter_shared.py` Helpers

Key helpers provided by `chatter_shared.py` for use across prompt and
delivery code:

| Helper | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `calculate_dynamic_delay(responsive=False)` | Delivery timing — skips distraction sim and uses a 2s floor when `responsive=True` |
| `find_addressed_bot(...)` | Named-bot detection + multi-addressed intent classification via LLM |
| `should_include_action()` | Single RNG roll gating narrator action inclusion (`random.random() < get_action_chance()`). Use at conversation delivery sites instead of calling `get_action_chance()` directly to avoid double-rolling the probability |
| `PromptParts(str)` | System/user prompt split wrapper; auto-detected by `call_llm()` |
| `build_talent_context(...)` | Talent-aware personality context builder |
| `build_race_class_context(...)` | Race/class identity and speech-trait injector |

The `should_include_action()` helper was introduced to fix an
`ActionChance` double-roll bug: `append_conversation_json_instruction`
was pre-filtering speakers with its own `_action_chance` RNG gate, then
delivery was rolling again, making effective probability p² instead of p.
The fix is: the prompt instruction now lists **all** eligible speakers
without pre-filtering; delivery enforces `ActionChance` once via
`should_include_action()`.

## 13m. Dungeon Context Injection

When a group is inside a dungeon or raid instance, party chatter prompt
builders replace zone/subzone lore with dungeon-specific flavor text.

`get_group_location()` now threads `map_id` to all major party chatter
prompt builders. Each builder calls `get_dungeon_flavor(map_id)` — if a
flavor entry exists for that map, it replaces the zone/subzone lore
block with the dungeon's atmospheric description and tone.

### Flavor gating

`get_zone_flavor()`, `get_subzone_lore()` and `get_dungeon_flavor()` are
RNG-gated at `chatter_shared.FLAVOR_CHANCE` (0.25). Every prompt builder
pulls from them regardless of the message category it picked, so ungated
they were the main reason bots narrated their surroundings in nearly
every line.

The gate is for prompt decoration only. Callers that use the lookup as
fact rather than flavor pass `always=True`, because a gated miss there
changes meaning rather than verbosity:

| Caller | Why it is ungated |
| --- | --- |
| `chatter_instance_context.build_instance_context()` | Derives `is_instance` from the lookup — gated, an NPC in Shadowfang Keep is told it is outdoors 75% of the time |
| `chatter_memory._resolve_location()` | Produces the memory's location label — gated, a Deadmines memory files under Westfall |
| `chatter_group_handlers` player-message metadata | Names the zone in the request log — gated, in-instance conversations log an outdoor zone |

Affected prompt builders:

- kill reaction
- loot reaction
- death reaction
- achievement / group achievement
- wipe reaction
- corpse run commentary
- nearby object (both statement and conversation)

Builders that intentionally do **not** receive dungeon context injection:

- OOM / low-health callouts (state-focused, not location-flavored)
- level-up (character milestone, independent of location)

---

## 13n. Persistent Bot–Player Memory

### Overview

Bots accumulate a bounded journal of shared moments with real players.
On re-invite, the bot delivers a reunion greeting that references past
experiences rather than treating the player as a stranger.

### Memory lifecycle

1. **Group join** (`process_group_join_event` / `process_group_join_batch_event`)
   - `start_session()` registers the bot in the in-memory session tracker
   - `get_bot_memories()` fetches up to 3 random `active=1` memories for this
     bot–player pair
   - If memories exist: `player_name_known=True` → reunion greeting mode
   - If no memories (first meeting): a `first_meeting` memory is inserted
     directly with `active=1` and `memory_type='first_meeting'`, guarded by
     `INSERT...SELECT...WHERE NOT EXISTS` to prevent duplicates on re-join.
     This memory is immune to both short-session discard and cap pruning.
   - A normal join generates the visible greeting and then pre-generates the
     farewell stored in `llm_group_bot_traits`. A player-session rejoin skips
     the duplicate greeting but still prepares the farewell. An existing
     persistent farewell is reused without an LLM call; a missing farewell is
     generated before the rejoin event completes.

2. **During the session** — event handlers may call `_generate_and_store_memory()`
   to produce LLM-generated memories (boss kills, notable events). These are
   inserted with `active=0` until flush.

3. **Group farewell** (`process_group_farewell_event` → `flush_session_memories()`)
   - C++ sends the prepared `llm_group_bot_traits.farewell_msg` synchronously
     during `OnRemoveMember`, before deleting the trait row. The Python
     farewell event does not generate the visible message.
   - If session was long enough (`SessionMinutes` threshold): activates `active=0`
     rows and prunes oldest memories to the `MaxPerBotPlayer` cap.
     `first_meeting` rows are excluded from the prune DELETE.
   - If session was too short: deletes all `active=0` rows for this session.
     `first_meeting` rows are `active=1` and unaffected.

4. **Reunion greeting** — when `get_bot_memories()` returns a non-empty list,
   the greeting prompt enters reunion mode: injects `<past_memories>` block,
   uses familiar tone, optionally recalls a specific memory (`recall_memory`).
   The `is_reunion` flag is `bool(memories and player_name_known)`, so a first
   meeting (where `memories=[]`) always produces a fresh greeting even though
   `player_name_known` is set to `True` for internal tracking.

### Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `chatter_memory.py` | Session tracking, memory generation (with `player_name` threading and DB fallback), flush, retrieval |
| `chatter_group.py` | Calls `start_session`, `get_bot_memories`, first-meeting insert |
| `chatter_group_prompts.py` | `build_bot_greeting_prompt` — reunion mode and `<past_memories>` injection |

### Database tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `llm_bot_memories` | Per-bot-per-player memory journal. `memory_type` includes `first_meeting`, `boss_kill`, `party_member`, etc. |
| `llm_bot_identities` | Persistent personality traits keyed by `bot_guid`. Regenerated only on `IdentityVersion` bump. |

### Config keys

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `LLMChatter.Memory.Enable` | `1` | Master toggle |
| `LLMChatter.Memory.SessionMinutes` | `15` | Minimum session length to activate memories |
| `LLMChatter.Memory.MaxPerBotPlayer` | `50` | Cap on active memories per bot–player pair |
| `LLMChatter.Memory.RecallChance` | `30` | % chance a specific memory is highlighted in reunion greeting |
| `LLMChatter.Memory.IdentityVersion` | `1` | Bump to force personality regeneration for all bots |

---

## 13o. Queue and Message Cleanup

The system has four cleanup layers that work together to ensure stale
queue entries and undelivered messages are never visible to players after
a group ends.

| Layer | Trigger | Scope | Mechanism |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------|
| `OnRemoveMember` | Bot removed from group | That bot only | Cancels queue entries containing `bot_guid`; marks messages delivered |
| `CleanupGroupSession` | Group disbands or no real player remains | Full group | Cancels all queue entries for group bots; marks messages delivered. Runs **before** deleting `llm_group_bot_traits` so IN-subqueries resolve correctly |
| Bridge TTL | Every poll cycle | Global (5-min window) | Cancels `llm_chatter_queue` entries `> 5 MINUTE` old; marks messages `> 5 MINUTE` past `deliver_at` |
| `OnPlayerLogin` | Real player logs in | Global (30-second grace) | Crash-recovery only. Cancels queue entries `> 30 SECOND` old; marks messages `> 30 SECOND` past `deliver_at`. Protects freshly-queued entries from other online players |

The 30-second grace in `OnPlayerLogin` means other players' active entries
(queued < 30 seconds ago) are safe. In normal operation `CleanupGroupSession`
handles everything; `OnPlayerLogin` only matters after a server crash.

---

## 13q. Proximity Chatter

Bots and NPCs can engage in ambient `/say` conversations as the player
moves through outdoor maps, dungeons, and raids. Unlike General-channel
chatter (zone-wide) or
party chat (group-scoped), proximity chatter is spatially local — only
players and bots within `/say` range (~40 yards) see it.

### Scan and trigger

C++ `CheckProximityChatter(bool instanceMaps)` runs on independent
outdoor and dungeon/raid timers in `LLMChatterWorld.cpp`, delegating to
`LLMChatterProximity.cpp`. Older configs without scoped keys inherit the
legacy `ScanIntervalSeconds` and `Chance` values:

1. Iterates alive, out-of-combat real players in eligible maps
2. Scans within `ProximityChatter.ScanRadius` (default 40 yards) for
   eligible NPCs and party bots
3. NPC eligibility follows one policy in every supported map: universal
   life/combat/range/LOS safety checks; `SpeakerDenyEntries`;
   boss exclusion; guards and strong interactive NPC roles; humanoids;
   then explicitly allowlisted non-humanoid entries. Everything else is
   rejected. This permits carefully selected friendly or hostile
   non-humanoids without making ordinary wildlife or summons talk.
   Creatures the player cannot detect, non-selectable or fake-dead
   creatures, engine-marked triggers, and templates carrying the internal
   `[DND]`/`(DND)`, `[PH]`/`(PH)`, or `[UNUSED]`/`(UNUSED)` markers are
   always rejected so spell, event, placeholder, and encounter helpers
   cannot speak.
   Movement and pathing do not disqualify an otherwise eligible speaker.
4. Bot eligibility: party bots can participate, but conversations
   where all speakers are party bots are skipped (idle chat handles
   that case)
5. Rolls `OutdoorChance` or `InstanceChance` for the current map
6. Selects 1-4 speakers from the candidate pool
7. Queues either a `proximity_say` (single statement) or
   `proximity_conversation` (multi-speaker) event

NPCs are identified by spawn GUID (`Creature::GetSpawnId()`) rather
than entry ID. Map and instance IDs scope cooldowns, active scenes, and
reply history so separate copies of the same dungeon cannot share
context. Mutually hostile candidates cannot join one ambient scene.

### Delivery channels

Three local delivery channels are handled by
`LLMChatterDelivery.cpp`:

| Channel | Packet | Visual |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `say` | `CHAT_MSG_SAY` | Normal `/say` text for bots |
| `msay` | `CHAT_MSG_MONSTER_SAY` | NPC speech bubble |
| `myell` | monster yell | Extended-range boss line |

Ordinary-scene facing is best effort. A speaker with only idle or random
movement may rotate via `SetFacingToObject()`; any scripted or controlled
movement speaks without rotation. Directed rows can identify the real
player, bot, or NPC addressee explicitly, so NPC asides face the other NPC
while player-inclusive lines face the player when appropriate. One facing
lease is kept through the final queued line before the original orientation
is restored.

### Player reply detection

When a real player speaks in `/say`, a selected eligible NPC is the
addressee. Another nearby NPC overrides that selection only when its name
is explicitly marked as a vocative with an adjacent comma or colon. With no
selection, an unambiguous full name or meaningful token that is unique
among nearby candidates can direct the line anywhere it occurs. Subnames
and configurable title/place stopwords are excluded; ambiguous matches fail
closed. A differently named NPC is the preferred joiner rather than
automatically replacing the selected addressee. A living selected player,
party bot, boss, or runtime-ineligible speaking NPC suppresses random
fallback with a diagnostic reason. Dead and non-speaking targets such as
corpses and critters are ignored, allowing normal fallback. The
`ProximityScene` struct tracks:

- active conversation participants
- map, instance, zone, and timestamp
- the original topic context

This enables natural player-to-NPC/bot exchanges while making direct
targeting authoritative when the player uses it. Every direct `/say` and
eligible NPC emote starts with the addressed NPC, then independently
selects zero to three additional compatible NPCs. The default weights are
60%, 25%, 10%, and 5% for zero through three joiners, respectively. A
multi-NPC event is either player-inclusive or an NPC aside that discusses
the player's real words/action without addressing or inventing speech for
the player.
Mounted players remain eligible for these directed interactions. Mounting
continues to suppress automatic scenes, untargeted fallback selection, and
active-scene continuation.

### Instance and boss grounding

Every ordinary proximity prompt receives the canonical DBC map name,
map and instance IDs, zone/current-area names, and existing curated
dungeon flavor where available. `chatter_instance_context.py` owns this
shared normalization. NPCs also carry disposition and creature rank.
Curated non-humanoids additionally carry creature type and their
qualification reason so the model knows that the individual can speak
without generalizing that ability to its whole species.
Normal-mode playerbots treat lore as game knowledge; actual NPCs always
remain in-world speakers.

Bosses use a separate path in `LLMChatterBossDialogue.cpp` instead of
joining random ambient scenes. Automatic approach lines and explicitly
selected/named boss replies require the player and boss to be alive,
out of combat, in LOS, in the same dungeon/raid instance, within the
configured boss radius, and beyond calculated aggro range plus the
safety margin. Delivery checks those conditions again. Boss lines use
monster yell for audibility and never change facing or threat. Automatic
lines use a presence session shared by boss spawn and instance, rather
than one cooldown per player. The first line follows a short random
delay. Later speaking opportunities use random delays and a decaying
chance that stops at a configurable floor. A failed roll schedules the
next delayed opportunity instead of rerolling on every scanner pass.
The boss therefore retains a small chance to speak throughout a long
presence. Open-ended opportunities are enabled by default through an
explicit toggle; disabling that toggle restores the optional hard cap.
The session
resets after no eligible player has remained nearby for the configured
period. Recent delivered boss lines are included in later prompts to
discourage repeats and paraphrases.

Explicitly addressed `/say` replies keep their separate per-player
cooldown and postpone the next automatic opportunity without consuming
the automatic line allowance. Dungeon and raid miniboss qualification
uses AzerothCore's registered creature encounters first, with boss-rank,
boss-flag, and single-spawn immunity metadata as fallbacks for special
encounters not present in that registry. This classifier is also used by
group-kill chatter, so eligible registered encounters receive the existing
guaranteed boss-kill reaction rather than normal-trash chance and cooldown
handling. Enter-combat chatter keeps its narrower legacy classifier. Use
`BossSpeakerDenyEntries` for encounters whose scripted presentation
must not receive generated dialogue. Automatic checks use a fair
round-robin schedule with one player and at most one creature-grid search
per configured scan pass. Extended searches caused by `/say` have a
separate per-player/map/instance throttle. During that short window,
an unrelated line is not consumed merely because a boss remains targeted.
A short
boss-name match is ignored when it could refer to different nearby boss
entries unless the selected target disambiguates it; a full name remains
authoritative.

### Topic pools

`PROXIMITY_CHAT_TOPICS` in `chatter_constants.py` provides 250+
topics across 17 categories:

- weather, travel, local flavor, trade, rumors, daily life, military,
  faction politics, wildlife, profession, food and drink, history,
  adventure, philosophy, humor, seasonal, and general social

That pool remains the source for NPCs and roleplay-mode playerbots.
`PROXIMITY_PLAYER_CHAT_TOPICS` supplies normal-mode playerbot `/say`
subjects such as gameplay progress, interface/keybind observations,
queues, routes, group needs, and light player banter. Mixed conversations
receive separate NPC and playerbot topic angles.

### Python handling

`chatter_proximity.py` owns the ordinary event handlers:

| Event type | Handler | Behavior |
|------------|---------|----------|
| `proximity_say` | Single NPC or bot statement | One speaker, zone context + topic |
| `proximity_conversation` | Multi-speaker conversation | 2-4 speakers with staggered delivery |
| `proximity_reply` | Player reply response | NPC/bot replies to player `/say` |
| `proximity_player_say` | Directed/nearby response | Addressed NPC replies |
| `proximity_player_conversation` | Directed nearby exchange | Addressed NPC plus selected joiners |
| `proximity_player_emote` | Directed social emote | Addressed NPC verbal response, optionally with joiners |

`chatter_boss_dialogue.py` owns `proximity_boss_approach` and
`proximity_boss_player_say`. Both produce one message-only `myell` row
tagged with `owner_subsystem='boss_dialogue'`.

Prompts include up to four distinct nearby entity names so speakers can
address each other without repeating identical names. One conversation
also selects at most one speaker with a given display name because the
response contract identifies speakers by name. Directed parsing accepts
only exact names or unique tokens, validates an optional `addressee`, and
falls back to the addressed NPC if the conversation output is invalid.
Roster entries identify each participant as `NPC` or
`PLAYERBOT`; the prompt keeps NPCs in-world and applies ChatterMode only
to playerbots. Uses global `EmoteChance` and `ActionChance` gates (not
custom proximity-specific ones).

### Schema changes

Migration `20260403_proximity_chatter.sql` adds two columns to
`llm_chatter_messages`:

- `npc_spawn_id` INT UNSIGNED DEFAULT NULL — creature spawn GUID for
  NPC speakers
- `player_guid` INT UNSIGNED DEFAULT NULL — real player GUID for
  proximity scene tracking

Base schema `00000000_llm_chatter_tables.sql` updated to match.

Migration `20260914_npc_multidirectional_interactions.sql` adds
`proximity_player_emote`, `drop_reason`, and the three nullable addressee
columns (`addressee_player_guid`, `addressee_bot_guid`, and
`addressee_npc_spawn_id`). A consumed row still sets `delivered = 1`;
successful speech has a null `drop_reason`, while failed delivery records a
specific reason. Addressed history excludes dropped rows, includes the
player's stored line, and stays scoped to the same addressed NPC, map, and
instance. A dropped line in a directed event cancels its remaining lines.
Apply this migration before starting a bridge or worldserver binary that
contains the new message insert and delivery queries.

Migration `20260908_instance_proximity_boss_events.sql` extends the
`llm_chatter_events.event_type` enum with `proximity_boss_approach`
and `proximity_boss_player_say`. Existing installations require this
migration before boss dialogue can be enabled. Fresh installs receive
the event types from the base schema.

## 13r. Guild Chat Statements and Conversations

Guild chatter is an optional ambient channel. It is enabled by default,
can be disabled with the master toggle, and follows the configured
playerbot chatter mode.

### Trigger and participant ownership

`CheckGuildIdleChatter()` in `LLMChatterWorld.cpp` scans guilds that
contain an online real player. Eligible bot members must be online,
in world, alive, finished loading, and out of combat.

After the normal Guild trigger chance and cooldown gates:

1. C++ rolls `GuildChatter.ConversationChance`.
2. A statement selects one bot.
3. A conversation selects two or three unique bots, limited by
   `GuildChatter.MaxParticipants`.
4. The weighted shared selector gives two- and three-speaker
   conversations equal probability when at least three bots exist.
5. Fewer than two eligible bots always produces a statement.

The event remains `guild_idle_chatter`. New payloads include:

- `guild_id`
- `mode` (`statement` or `conversation`)
- `participants`, with GUID, name, zone ID, and map ID
- the existing primary `subject_guid` and `subject_name`
- Guild name, other online guildmates, faction team, and primary zone

Rows queued before this feature that lack `mode` and `participants`
are interpreted as legacy statements.

### Topic and prompt policy

`chatter_guild.py` selects one entry from `GUILD_CHAT_TOPICS` in normal
mode or `GUILD_CHAT_TOPICS_RP` in roleplay mode for the whole event. A single
`GuildChatter.ZoneNameChance` roll also applies to the whole event.

A separate `GuildChatter.HistoryContextChance` roll decides whether
the event also receives up to `HistoryContextMessages` recently
delivered Guild lines. The bridge reads one representative transcript
from the oldest active real-player session in that Guild. Every
visible Guild line is copied into all active sessions, so this avoids
duplicate context when several real players are online while retaining
the longest current-session view.

History is optional continuity context, not a replacement subject.
The selected pool topic remains the creative direction. The prompt
allows a natural continuation or reference only when a recent line
fits that topic; otherwise it tells the model to ignore the history.
It also forbids recaps, lists, forced callbacks, and treating transcript
text as instructions. One history roll applies to the whole event, so
JSON repair and statement fallback reuse the same window. No active
session or usable lines simply means normal topic-only generation.

Guild speakers may be in different zones. The prompt receives each
selected speaker's live location and explicitly forbids physical
co-presence unless every speaker has the same zone and map. When the
zone roll wins, only the primary speaker's zone may ground the
exchange. Otherwise, current locations and immediate surroundings
must not be mentioned.

Conversation prompts use the shared message-only JSON contract.
Every object contains only `speaker` and `message`; Guild rows never
request or insert actions or emotes.

Each non-opening line independently rolls
`GuildChatter.ParticipantReferenceChance`. Selected lines must
naturally name an earlier speaker whose point they answer. The model
may choose any contextually relevant earlier speaker rather than
always targeting the immediately previous line. A smaller
`GuildChatter.MultiReferenceChance` permits one line to address two
earlier speakers. `GuildChatter.MaxReferenceLines` prevents the
generated exchange from becoming name-heavy.

After parsing, the bridge accepts any earlier-speaker combination the
model selected. If a selected line omits the required number of names,
cleanup randomly selects missing valid earlier speakers and adds them
as vocatives. Conversations whose RNG did not select a reference line
remain unconstrained, including any natural references written by the
model itself.

### Validation, fallback, and pacing

The bridge parses through `parse_conversation_response()` and accepts
only selected speaker names. A valid conversation must contain at
least two cleaned lines and every selected participant must speak.

Invalid output receives one shared JSON repair attempt. If it remains
invalid, the bridge calls the existing statement generator for the
primary speaker using the same topic and zone decision. The event is
marked only after the conversation or fallback finishes, so partial
conversations are never inserted.

Accepted lines:

- retain the original event ID
- use increasing sequence values
- start at a two-second delay
- add `calculate_dynamic_delay()` for each later line
- use the actual speaker GUID
- insert with `channel='guild'` and
  `owner_subsystem='guild'`

One whole exchange consumes one existing per-Guild cooldown.

## 13s. Player-Driven Guild Replies and Session Memory

When Guild chatter and `GuildChatter.PlayerReplies.Enable` are enabled,
every eligible real-player Guild message queues a bot response. The
guarantee applies when the player still has a current login session, at
least one eligible Guild bot exists, and the configured LLM returns a
usable response.

### Session lifecycle and transcript

`LLMChatterGuild.cpp` owns the session boundary:

- login clears any stale row and creates a fresh per-player session
- logout cancels pending turns and deletes the session and transcript
- a new login never inherits the previous login's Guild memory
- each Guild line from a real player is recorded in every active
  session for that Guild
- successfully delivered bot Guild lines are likewise recorded in
  every active Guild session

`llm_guild_session_history.source_kind` distinguishes `player`, `reply`,
and `ambient` lines. The reply prompt may see recent visible lines of
all three kinds. By default, the latest 15 visible Guild messages are
always available when a real player's Guild message is being answered,
including ambient statements and every line of ambient conversations.
Autonomous Guild statements and conversations receive the same raw
visible-line window only when their independent history-context roll
wins. They never receive the compact rolling summary. Rolling summaries
include only player-driven interaction (`player` and delivered `reply`)
so older ambient chatter does not dilute the relationship memory.

### Turn ownership and interruption

Each player session has a monotonically increasing `turn_id`. A new
player message:

1. advances the turn
2. cancels a pending or queued login greeting
3. cancels older pending `guild_player_message` events
4. consumes any undelivered continuation rows from the older turn
5. queues the new turn after `PlayerReplies.DebounceSeconds`

The bridge checks the session and turn before generation and again
before inserting output. A player can therefore interrupt a bot
conversation naturally without receiving obsolete continuation lines.

### Reply selection

Eligible Guild bots are live, loaded, alive, out of combat, and in the
same Guild. The server shuffles and caps this candidate set; the bridge
then rolls one of three response shapes:

- one direct bot reply
- two or three independent bot replies
- a coherent two- or three-bot conversation started by the player

An explicitly addressed bot is the primary responder. Otherwise,
recent speakers receive a soft configurable weight penalty so the same
Guild member does not dominate every exchange.

The conversation roll remains independent and runs first. If it fails,
the bridge rolls the independent multi-reply chance. A message clearly
addressed to several guildmates receives a configurable bonus to that
second roll, but never forces multiple responses. With the defaults, an
ordinary player message is approximately 68% single reply, 12%
independent multi-reply, and 20% conversation.

Bridge-side RNG decides whether to request:

- a natural player-name address
- a subtle callback to earlier session material
- a follow-up question
- participant-name references inside multi-bot conversations

The model decides the wording and contextual relationship. Where a
requested name is omitted, deterministic cleanup inserts it as a
natural vocative. These features are intentionally probabilistic, not
systematic.

### Rolling summary

Prompts use a hybrid memory:

- older interaction material in a compact factual summary
- the newest configured number of messages verbatim

When older unsummarized interaction text reaches
`SessionMemory.SummaryThresholdChars`, the bridge makes one additional
summary call after reply rows have been queued. It uses the same client,
provider, and model configured for all chatter; there is no dependency
on any specific model. The compact prompt preserves exact
names, explicit player facts, established opinions, unresolved
questions, and promises while rejecting invention.

Recent player interaction also suppresses ambient Guild triggers for
`PlayerReplies.IdleSuppressionSeconds`, giving the exchange a natural
period of silence. The first bot reply waits for a Guild-specific
8-20-second delay by default. Additional replies use the shared full
reading, typing, and distraction pacing rather than the faster direct
response path used by other chatter.

### Player-reply configuration

## 13t. Guild Login Greetings

When Guild chatter and `GuildChatter.LoginGreeting.Enable` are enabled,
a real guild member's full character login schedules one greeting
attempt. `LLMChatterGuild.cpp` uses the existing
`PLAYERHOOK_ON_LOGIN`; AzerothCore and `mod-playerbots` remain
unmodified read-only dependencies.

### Deferred bot readiness

The login hook does not immediately select a speaker. Playerbots may
finish loading asynchronously, and supported server configurations may
wait 30 seconds after the first real player arrives before starting
random bots.

The Guild subsystem stores a small pending record containing the player
GUID, Guild ID, session ID, initial delay, and expiry. Once per second
the world coordinator calls the Guild-owned update function. At the due
time it reuses the normal live Guild-bot checks:

- in world
- alive
- not in combat
- current WorldSession
- no longer loading
- same Guild as the player

If no candidate is ready, the check repeats after
`LoginGreeting.RetryInterval` until
`LoginGreeting.ReadinessTimeout`. The attempt then expires silently;
it never surprises the player with a very late greeting.

### Initial timing

The first greeting uses weighted delay bands:

| Band | Default weight | Delay |
|------|---------------:|------:|
| Quick | 20% | 2-5 seconds |
| Ordinary | 55% | 8-20 seconds |
| Busy | 25% | 25-45 seconds |

`QuickChance` and `BusyChance` are configurable. The ordinary weight is
the remaining percentage. The server clamps BusyChance so the two
configured weights cannot exceed 100.

This pending timer is the first message's human-response delay. The
bridge inserts the first generated greeting with no second artificial
delay; normal LLM latency may still make it appear slightly later.
Additional greeters use the shared reading, typing, and distraction
pacing.

### Responder and prompt behavior

One high-priority `guild_login_greeting` event carries the current
session, target player, delay band, and shuffled live candidates.
`chatter_guild_login.py` normally selects one responder. On a
`LoginGreeting.MultiReplyChance` success, it selects two or three,
bounded by `LoginGreeting.MaxResponders` and available candidates.

One LLM request generates the complete greeting sequence. Prompts:

- ask for one distinct 3-12-word greeting per selected bot
- forbid bot-to-bot conversation
- forbid invented absence length, destination, or player intent
- retain the normal Guild cross-zone and configured chatter-mode rules
- allow only the primary greeter to be asked to use the player's name
- enforce `LoginGreeting.MaxCharacters` after cleanup

Malformed multi-message JSON receives one repair attempt and then falls
back to a single greeter. The same configured provider and model used by
all chatter is used for greetings.

### Cancellation and session safety

A greeting belongs to the fresh login session at `turn_id=0`. It is
cancelled when:

- the player speaks in Guild Chat before it arrives
- the player logs out or fully logs in again
- the player changes Guild
- its Guild session or turn becomes stale
- the module, Guild chatter, or login greeting toggle is disabled
- no Guild bot becomes ready before timeout

The bridge checks the session and turn before the LLM call and again
before inserting messages. Successful delivery records each greeting as
`source_kind='reply'`, so later player-driven Guild prompts can see what
the guildmates said during this login session.

A fast network reconnect to a character that never left the world does
not fire AzerothCore's full login hook and therefore does not create a
duplicate greeting.

### Login-greeting configuration

| Key | Default | Owner | Purpose |
|-----|---------|-------|---------|
| `LoginGreeting.Enable` | 1 | Server/Bridge | Login greeting toggle |
| `LoginGreeting.Chance` | 100 | Server | Chance to schedule an attempt |
| `LoginGreeting.QuickChance` | 20 | Server | Weight of 2-5s delay |
| `LoginGreeting.BusyChance` | 25 | Server | Weight of 25-45s delay |
| `LoginGreeting.RetryInterval` | 5 | Server | Bot readiness retry |
| `LoginGreeting.ReadinessTimeout` | 90 | Server | Total bounded wait |
| `LoginGreeting.MaxCandidates` | 12 | Server | Live candidate cap |
| `LoginGreeting.MultiReplyChance` | 20 | Bridge | Multiple-greeter chance |
| `LoginGreeting.MaxResponders` | 3 | Bridge | Greeter cap |
| `LoginGreeting.PlayerNameChance` | 60 | Bridge | Primary name chance |
| `LoginGreeting.MaxCharacters` | 100 | Bridge | Per-greeting hard cap |

Existing installations must also apply
`data/sql/characters/updates/20260725_guild_login_greeting.sql` because
`llm_chatter_events.event_type` is an SQL enum.

## 13u. Gear, Pet, and Room Context

`LLMChatter.GearContext.Enable` (default 1, bridge-side) tells a bot what
it is actually carrying instead of leaving it to invent gear — a
mace-wielder describing a sword swing, or a hunter treating its own pet
as a stranger.

### What is looked up

`build_gear_context()` in `chatter_shared.py` reads the character
database for the equipped main hand, off hand, and ranged items (name and
item type) plus the pet of a hunter or warlock (name and species). The
result is cached per bot for five minutes, so the cost is one small query
every few minutes rather than one per message. `run_group_handler()` in
`chatter_handler_pipeline.py` attaches it as `bot['gear']`.

### How it is rendered

| Scene | Voice | Example |
|---|---|---|
| A bot speaking alone | Second person | `You are wielding Fist of Reckoning (one-handed mace)`, `Your pet is Kreenum, a Felhunter` |
| Multi-speaker scene (party, ambient) | Third person | `Veliana wields Staff of the Sun (staff)` |

Third person in multi-speaker scenes keeps gear from being misattributed
to whoever the model is currently speaking as. Article grammar follows
the species name (`an Imp`, `a Felhunter`).

### Emote prompts

Emote prompts previously carried neither the party roster nor recent chat
history, so a bot reacted to a `/point` with no idea what had just been
said. Both are now included, with the real player marked in the roster.

An unfamiliar emote target outside the group is described by level, race,
class, and gender (`Soza, a level 28 female Troll Warrior`) rather than
the bare `Soza, a stranger` — which is what let a bot call an orc a
centaur because centaurs had come up earlier in the conversation. The
extra fields ride on the `bot_group_emote_observer` event as
`target_race`, `target_class`, `target_level`, and `target_gender`, and
fall back to a stranger only when nothing is known.

---

## 14. JSON and Queue Contracts

### `QueueChatterEvent()`

Shared C++ insert helper:

- implemented in `LLMChatterShared.cpp`
- declared in `LLMChatterShared.h`

Critical rule:

- direct callers must pass JSON text that is already SQL-safe

Wrappers like world-private `QueueEvent()` handle that escaping
internally.

The nearby-object direct world path now explicitly escapes `extraJson`
before calling `QueueChatterEvent()`.

### Statement response contract

Typical single-message JSON shape:

```json
{"message": "...", "emote": null, "action": null}
```

### Conversation response contract

Typical multi-message JSON shape:

```json
[
  {"speaker": "BotA", "message": "...", "emote": null, "action": null},
  {"speaker": "BotB", "message": "...", "emote": null, "action": null}
]
```

## 16. Important Editing Rules

### Separation of Concerns

New features or subsystems must go in their own file(s). Never dump
unrelated logic into an existing file. Shared utilities belong in the
dedicated shared layer (`LLMChatterShared.cpp/h` for C++,
`chatter_shared.py` / `chatter_constants.py` for Python). Each file
should have one clear ownership domain.

### `enabledHooks`

Any new or changed C++ hook override must add the correct enum to the
constructor's `enabledHooks` vector or it will silently never fire.

### C++ file routing

- `LLMChatterDelivery.cpp` for outbound delivery logic
- `LLMChatterAmbient.cpp` for ambient world/event logic
- `LLMChatterNearby.cpp` for nearby scan logic
- `LLMChatterProximity.cpp` for proximity chatter scan and scene logic
- `LLMChatterWorld.cpp` for world transport/dispatcher logic
- `LLMChatterGroup.cpp` for group shared helpers, cleanup, registration
- `LLMChatterGroupCombat.cpp` for group PlayerScript hooks and combat
  state
- `LLMChatterGroupJoin.cpp` for join batching and GroupScript
- `LLMChatterGroupEmote.cpp` for emote reaction system
- `LLMChatterGroupQuest.cpp` for quest accept batching and CreatureScript
- `LLMChatterProximity.cpp` for proximity chatter scan and scene logic
- `LLMChatterPlayer.cpp` for General-channel player logic
- `LLMChatterShared.cpp` for shared helper contracts
- `LLMChatterScript.cpp` is registration only — do not add features here

### Compile policy

Do not compile automatically.
Wait for explicit user approval before running build steps.
