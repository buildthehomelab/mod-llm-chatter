# mod-llm-chatter Architecture

Last updated: 2026-09-08 (instance proximity chatter)

## Purpose

Reference architecture for humans and LLMs editing
`modules/mod-llm-chatter`.

This document reflects the current source architecture.

For new work, route by ownership first. If you are unsure where a
change belongs, use "Where To Edit What" in this file before touching
code.

## Guiding Principle: Separation of Concerns

New features or subsystems must go in their own file(s) — never dump
unrelated logic into an existing file just because it is convenient.
Shared utilities belong in the dedicated shared layer
(`LLMChatterShared.cpp/h` for C++, `chatter_shared.py` /
`chatter_constants.py` for Python). Each file should have one clear
ownership domain.

Keeping files focused allows AI agents to work on a single file without
loading the entire module into context.

## Repository Boundaries

- **AzerothCore root repo**: the parent AzerothCore server repo where
  this module is installed under `modules/mod-llm-chatter`
- **Module repo**: `modules/mod-llm-chatter` — all runtime Python and
  C++ code lives here
- Runtime code changes belong in the module repo
- This architecture doc lives in `docs/` inside the module repo

## Docker Bind Mounts

The chatter bridge container has two relevant volume mounts:

| Host path | Container path | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `modules/mod-llm-chatter/tools/` | `/app/tools/` | `:ro` | Python source (read-only) |
| `modules/mod-llm-chatter/logs/` | `/logs/` | `:rw` | LLM request log output |

The `/logs` mount is defined in `docker-compose.override.yml` under
`ac-llm-chatter-bridge`. The log path config key
`LLMChatter.RequestLog.Path` must point inside `/logs/` to write to
the host filesystem.

**Important**: adding or changing volume mounts requires container
recreation (`docker compose --profile dev up -d ac-llm-chatter-bridge`),
not just `docker restart`.

## High-Level Runtime Flow

1. C++ scripts queue ambient requests and event rows in MySQL.
2. Python bridge polls pending work and routes by event type.
3. Python generates messages and writes them to
   `llm_chatter_messages`.
4. C++ world tick delivers messages in game.
5. Party-channel delivery may play text emotes; General, Guild,
   Raid, and BG delivery does not.

### Proximity chatter data flow

Proximity chatter creates ambient `/say` conversations between bots,
NPCs, and real players as they move through the world:

1. C++ `CheckProximityChatter(bool instanceMaps)` runs on independent
   outdoor and dungeon/raid timers in `LLMChatterWorld.cpp`. Legacy
   configs without scoped values inherit `ScanIntervalSeconds`.
2. `LLMChatterProximity.cpp` scans around each alive, out-of-combat
   real player within a 40-yard radius for eligible NPCs and party bots.
   Outdoor, dungeon, and raid maps are supported; BG and arena maps are
   excluded. NPC qualification follows one global ordered policy:
   client visibility, non-selectable, fake-dead, trigger-creature, and
   internal-name-marker exclusions; denylist; boss exclusion;
   guard/interactive role; humanoid; configured non-humanoid allowlist;
   then reject.
3. One or more speakers are selected from the candidate pool. If all
   candidates are party bots, the scan is skipped (idle chat handles
   that case). Directed player interactions instead keep the addressed
   NPC first and can add zero to three compatible nearby NPCs.
4. A `proximity_say` (single statement) or `proximity_conversation`
   (multi-speaker) event is queued to `llm_chatter_events` with
   NPC spawn GUIDs and nearby entity names in `extra_data`.
5. Python `chatter_proximity.py` claims the event and uses
   `chatter_instance_context.py` for canonical map name, current area,
   and curated dungeon-lore grounding. NPC payloads also carry
   disposition, creature rank, creature type, and qualification reason.
6. Messages are written to `llm_chatter_messages` with channel
   `"say"` (for bots) or `"msay"` (for NPCs).
7. C++ delivery dispatches bot messages via `CHAT_MSG_SAY` and NPC
   messages via `CHAT_MSG_MONSTER_SAY` (speech bubbles). Movement never
   disqualifies a speaker. Only idle or random-wandering NPCs may rotate.
   A directed line uses its explicit addressee when present; otherwise
   the conversation sequence supplies the fallback. One facing lease is
   retained through the final line before the original orientation is
   restored. Scripted or controlled movement speaks without rotation.
8. When a real player speaks in `/say`, a selected eligible NPC is the
   addressee unless another nearby NPC name is explicitly marked with a
   comma or colon as a vocative. Without a selection, an unambiguous full
   name or unique meaningful token can direct the line anywhere it occurs.
   Ambiguous title/place tokens are rejected. A different named NPC is
   preferred as a joining speaker. A living selected player, party bot,
   boss, or runtime-ineligible speaking NPC suppresses random fallback;
   dead and non-speaking targets are ignored. With no direct addressee,
   recent-scene and ordinary nearby fallback behavior remains available.
9. A social emote directed at an eligible NPC has its own verbal-reaction
   chance and cooldown, independent of animation mirroring. SmartAI and
   configured C++ scripted-emote ownership suppresses generated NPC and
   mirror reactions so scripted behavior remains authoritative. When a
   mirror animation is actually scheduled, its emote name is passed to the
   verbal prompt so generated speech cannot contradict the visible action.

NPCs are identified by spawn GUID (`Creature::GetSpawnId()`) rather
than entry ID. Cooldowns, scene matching, and history include map and
instance IDs so parallel copies cannot share state. Ordinary hostile
humanoids may speak while safely out of combat. A hostile non-humanoid
must be deliberately approved by creature entry unless its established
guard or interactive NPC role independently qualifies it. Bosses remain
outside this ambient scanner. `SpeakerDenyEntries` overrides every
ordinary qualification, including humanoids and interactive NPCs.
Internal `[DND]`/`(DND)`, `[PH]`/`(PH)`, and
`[UNUSED]`/`(UNUSED)` templates and engine-marked trigger creatures are
excluded across ordinary and boss dialogue. Nearby-name prompt context
is case-insensitively deduplicated.
One conversation also cannot select two creatures with the same display
name because the JSON response contract identifies speakers by name.
Directed multi-NPC prompts choose either a player-inclusive exchange or
an NPC aside about the player's real words/action. They never generate
dialogue or actions for the real player.

Boss dialogue is a separate flow owned by
`LLMChatterBossDialogue.cpp` and `chatter_boss_dialogue.py`. A boss can
produce a paced sequence of original pre-aggro lines or answer an
explicitly targeted or named `/say` within its extended radius. Queueing
and delivery both require LOS, no combat, an instance map, the shared
boss classifier, and distance greater than calculated aggro range plus
the configured safety margin. Delivery uses the private `myell` queue
channel and monster yell; it never changes facing or threat.

Automatic speech is governed by one presence session per boss spawn and
instance, shared by every nearby real player. The first line follows a
short random delay. Later opportunities use random delays and a decaying
chance that stops decaying at a configurable floor. A missed chance
schedules a new delayed opportunity instead of rerolling each scan, so
the boss retains a small chance to speak throughout a long presence.
Open-ended opportunities are enabled by default; disabling them applies
the configured hard line cap. The session resets after no eligible player
has been nearby for the configured period.
Recent delivered lines are passed back to the prompt so later speech
continues the moment without repeating it. A directed `/say` uses its
separate per-player cooldown and postpones the next automatic opportunity
without consuming the automatic line allowance.

The same comprehensive classifier remains shared with group-kill chatter.
Consequently, an eligible registered-encounter kill, including an
ordinary-rank miniboss, follows the existing guaranteed boss-kill reaction
path instead of normal-trash chance and cooldown rules. This is one reaction
opportunity per actual encounter kill, not a recurring proximity trigger.
Enter-combat chatter deliberately retains its narrower legacy classifier and
probabilities.

The boss denylist limits interference with scripted encounters.
Automatic checks use one round-robin candidate per configured scan pass,
so no more than one expensive creature-grid search runs per interval and
later session-map entries cannot starve. Directed `/say` searches have a
separate per-player/map/instance throttle. Presence, cooldown, pending,
and scan state is synchronized across the world update and player `/say`
hooks, but persistent event queries run outside that mutex. The parsed
denylist is published as an immutable configuration snapshot on load or
reload.

### Guild chatter data flow

Guild chatter reuses shared conversation mechanics while keeping
Guild-specific selection and context in their owning layers:

1. `CheckGuildIdleChatter()` in `LLMChatterWorld.cpp` finds live,
   non-combat guild bots in a guild containing an online real player.
2. C++ rolls `GuildChatter.ConversationChance`, shuffles the live
   roster, and selects one statement speaker or two to three
   conversation participants.
3. One `guild_idle_chatter` event carries `mode` plus structured
   participant GUID, name, zone, and map data. Legacy single-speaker
   payloads remain valid.
4. `chatter_guild.py` selects one RP topic and one event-level zone
   policy. A separate event-level RNG roll may attach up to the latest
   15 visible Guild lines from the oldest active Guild session as
   optional continuity context.
5. The selected topic remains the creative direction. The prompt may
   connect compatible history naturally, but must ignore unrelated
   history and never force a recap or callback. The same context
   decision survives JSON repair and statement fallback.
6. Independent bridge RNG may mark zero, one, or several non-opening
   lines to name contextually relevant earlier speakers. The model
   selects the connection; deterministic cleanup inserts missing
   names when a selected line ignores the cue.
7. Conversation output must contain every selected speaker. Invalid
   JSON gets one repair attempt, then falls back to a primary-speaker
   statement.
8. Accepted lines use shared dynamic delays and are inserted with the
   actual speaker GUID, `channel='guild'`, and
   `owner_subsystem='guild'`.
9. `LLMChatterDelivery.cpp` broadcasts each row through the existing
   Guild delivery branch.

Player-driven Guild exchanges use a separate, session-owned path:

1. `LLMChatterGuild.cpp` owns Guild player chat capture and login/logout
   lifecycle. A login starts a fresh `llm_guild_chat_sessions` row;
   login and logout both delete any prior session transcript.
2. A real player's Guild line is copied into every active session for
   that Guild, then the speaking player's `turn_id` advances.
3. The newest turn cancels older pending events and undelivered reply
   lines for that player session. One high-priority
   `guild_player_message` event is queued after a short debounce with
   the live eligible Guild-bot candidates.
4. `chatter_guild_player.py` selects an addressed bot first when
   applicable, applies a soft penalty to recent speakers, and rolls
   between one reply, multiple independent replies, or a genuine
   multi-bot conversation. A group-directed message raises the
   independent multi-reply chance without forcing multiple bots.
5. Player-reply prompts combine a compact rolling summary with the
   latest 15 visible Guild lines: player messages, player-driven
   replies, ambient statements, and ambient conversation lines.
   Autonomous Guild statements and conversations may receive the same
   raw visible-line window through an independent configurable chance,
   but never receive the private compact player-interaction summary.
   Older ambient lines are not folded into that summary.
6. Callback, player-name, follow-up-question, and participant-reference
   decisions are bridge-side RNG choices. Prompt validation and
   deterministic name insertion keep those choices enforceable across
   different configured models.
7. Summary compaction calls the same `call_llm()` path with the user's
   configured provider and model. It runs only after the unsummarized
   interaction text crosses a configurable threshold.
8. Successful Guild delivery records the visible bot line into every
   active Guild session. Recent player exchanges suppress ambient Guild
   triggers briefly so ambient chatter does not interrupt the player.
   Initial replies use a Guild-specific delay range; later replies use
   the shared full reading, typing, and distraction pacing.

Guild login greetings share the same session boundary without pretending
that playerbots are ready synchronously:

1. The existing `PLAYERHOOK_ON_LOGIN` handler starts the real player's
   Guild session. No AzerothCore or `mod-playerbots` source is modified.
2. `LLMChatterGuild.cpp` rolls one weighted initial delay: quick
   (2-5 seconds), ordinary (8-20), or busy (25-45).
3. Guild-owned pending state waits until the delay expires, then reuses
   the live eligible-bot selector. Missing or still-loading bots cause a
   bounded retry rather than an immediate loss.
4. Logout, relogin, Guild change, module disablement, session staleness,
   or a real Guild message cancels the greeting.
5. One high-priority `guild_login_greeting` event carries the current
   session, target player, delay metadata, and live bot candidates.
6. `chatter_guild_login.py` normally selects one greeter and
   occasionally two or three. One LLM request generates the whole
   sequence as short, distinct, message-only Guild lines.
7. The first line has no extra bridge-side delay because the C++ pending
   timer already supplied the human pause. Additional greeters reuse
   shared dynamic conversation pacing.
8. The bridge validates `session_id` and the initial `turn_id=0` before
   generation and insertion. A player message therefore supersedes an
   obsolete greeting even if the event was already claimed.
9. Native Guild delivery records successful greetings as `reply`
   history, making them visible to later player-session continuity.

## Chatter Mode Ownership

`tools/chatter_mode.py` owns the canonical playerbot identity boundary
and voice contract. In `normal` mode, playerbots speak as people playing
World of Warcraft; in `roleplay` mode, they speak as their characters in
Azeroth; in `instanced` mode they keep the player voice but tighten to a
working register. General, Party, Guild, Battleground, Raid, emote, and
playerbot `/say` prompt paths must use that shared contract rather than
defining independent versions of normal-mode behavior.

`LLMChatter.ChatterMode` is the default, not the answer. The mode for a
given message comes from `resolve_chatter_mode(config, channel, ...)`,
which layers a per-channel override and an instanced-content gate on top
of the configured value; group callers use the
`resolve_group_chatter_mode()` wrapper in `chatter_group_state.py`. No
other module may read `LLMChatter.ChatterMode` directly where a channel
is known, or the gate is silently bypassed for that path.

Actual NPCs do not follow the chatter mode at all. Proximity payloads
already identify them with `is_npc`; `chatter_proximity.py` therefore
keeps NPC speakers in-world while routing nearby playerbots through the
configured player voice. A mixed scene applies the rule per speaker.

Persistent character backstories and race/class worldview context are
RP-only prompt inputs. Normal-mode memory callbacks are presented as
past gameplay events. Pre-cached group replies have no mode column, so
the bridge deletes only `ready` cache rows at startup before refilling
them under the current mode, and `chatter_cache.py` drops a single
group's pool when that group's resolved mode changes under it.

## System Prompt Architecture

All prompt builders return a `PromptParts` object (defined in
`chatter_shared.py`). `PromptParts` subclasses `str` so it is
backward-compatible with code that treats prompts as plain strings.
It carries two extra attributes:

- `.system_prompt` — persona, rules, format instructions
- `.user_prompt` — event context, chat history, the actual task

### Flow

1. Prompt builder calls `PromptParts(system_prompt, user_prompt)`.
2. `call_llm()` or `quick_llm_analyze()` in `chatter_llm.py`
   auto-detects `PromptParts` via `_split_prompt()`.
3. Provider dispatch:
   - **DeepSeek / Ollama**: system role message + user role message;
     `llm_compat.py` builds the token and sampling parameters and
     applies any learned per-model overrides
   - **New or unrecognized models**: start with safe parameters; an
     explicit provider rejection can remove `temperature` or
     `reasoning_effort`, or switch the token-limit field, retry the
     rejected call, and cache that correction for the process lifetime
   - **DeepSeek thinking**: `_apply_deepseek_options()` always states the
     `thinking` object because DeepSeek enables it by default; an empty
     effort is read as `none`, temperature is dropped while thinking is
     on, and `_effective_max_tokens()` applies its multiplier only then
   - **Ollama**: context size is owned by the Ollama server because its
     OpenAI-compatible endpoint has no per-request context parameter;
     disabling thinking sends `reasoning_effort = none` and retains the
     `/no_think` prompt fallback
4. If a plain string is passed instead of `PromptParts`, the entire
   string is sent as a single user message (backward compatibility).

### Token-Saving Gates

Two config-driven RNG checks control optional prompt sections:

- `EmoteChance` - gates inclusion of the ~244-emote list (~500 tokens).
  Checked once per prompt build. Does NOT apply to General channel
  (emotes are proximity-based animations; General is zone-wide text,
  so emotes are intentionally suppressed via `skip_emote=True`).
- `ActionChance` - controls whether action narrations appear. Two
  strategies depending on path:
  - **Single statements**: pre-call RNG in `append_json_instruction()`
    decides before the LLM call whether to ask for an action (saves
    tokens when disabled).
  - **Conversations** (General, Proximity, Group idle, Group
    handlers): prompts always tell the LLM to include actions
    (in RP mode). `strip_conversation_actions()` in `chatter_shared.py`
    enforces ActionChance per-message post-parse. This avoids trusting
    the LLM to randomize naturally.

An action that survives those gates is delivered as a real text emote,
not inline asterisks: `split_action_prefix()` peels it back off the
message at insert time into the `action` column, and C++ sends it
through `Unit::TextEmote` just before the spoken line. Set
`LLMChatter.ActionAsEmote.Enable = 0` for the old `*action* text` form.

If the prompt/output parser yields `"emote": null`, Python insert paths
must preserve that null value. Do not synthesize a fallback emote during
DB insert. `LLMChatter.EmoteChance` is the source of truth for whether
the LLM is even asked for an emote.

## Queue Model, Timing, and Priority

The module currently uses three separate DB-backed queues. They do not
share one global scheduler.

### 1) `llm_chatter_queue` - legacy ambient request queue

- used for legacy ambient General chatter requests
- inserted by C++ in `LLMChatterWorld.cpp`
- consumed by `process_pending_requests()` in
  `llm_chatter_bridge.py`
- fetched FIFO: `ORDER BY created_at ASC`
- gated by `LLMChatter.MaxPendingRequests`, which currently limits only
  this queue, not the event queue

### 2) `llm_chatter_events` - reactive/event queue

- used for `bot_group_*`, `bg_*`, `player_general_msg`, weather,
  transport, holiday, and related event-driven work
- rows carry `priority`, `react_after`, and `expires_at`
- fetched by the bridge only when:
  - `status = 'pending'`
  - `react_after <= NOW()` or null
  - `expires_at > NOW()` or null
- claim order is:
  - `ORDER BY priority DESC, created_at ASC`
- workers claim via compare-and-swap update to `processing`

### 3) `llm_chatter_messages` - outbound delivery queue

- Python writes final chat rows here with a `deliver_at` timestamp
- C++ delivery polls one ready row at a time
- when `LLMChatter.PrioritySystem.Enable = 1` and
  `LLMChatter.PrioritySystem.DeliveryOrderEnable = 1`, delivery joins
  back to `llm_chatter_events` and orders by:
  `COALESCE(e.priority, 0) DESC, m.deliver_at ASC`
- ambient rows with `event_id = NULL` therefore remain lowest priority
- when the delivery-order feature is disabled, fallback order remains
  `deliver_at ASC`
- `delivered = 1` means the row was consumed, not necessarily spoken;
  `drop_reason IS NULL` distinguishes successful delivery from a drop
- directed rows carry optional player, bot, or NPC addressee IDs used for
  facing; dropping one directed line cancels its remaining queued lines

### Timing layers

There are two separate timing stages:

- **Event reaction delay**: C++ sets `react_after` when the event row is
  inserted. This delays when Python is allowed to process the event.
  The shared C++ implementation now uses table-driven priority and delay
  registries rather than long conditional chains.
- **Message delivery delay**: Python sets `deliver_at` when it inserts
  the final message row. This delays when C++ is allowed to speak it in
  game.

`calculate_dynamic_delay()` in `chatter_shared.py` controls the second
stage for most Python-generated messages. Player-directed replies use
`responsive=True`; ambient/group conversations can also include reading
time from the previous message length.
Player-triggered proximity say, active-scene reply, conversation, and emote
events use the high priority tier (0-2 second reaction delay by default) and
a short expiry, while ambient proximity events remain lower priority.

### General-Channel Pacing Gate

Automated General statements and conversations share a bridge-side,
per-zone reservation timeline. A producer calculates every relative
follow-up delay, then atomically reserves the full sequence through its
last scheduled line. The next ambient or world-event sequence begins
only after `GeneralChat.MinZoneGap` has elapsed from that endpoint. This
prevents independently processed ambient, transport, weather, and
holiday conversations from stacking their follow-ups into the same few
seconds. Player-directed General replies remain responsive and may
interrupt automated chatter, but extend the known zone endpoint so later
automation backs off.

### Party Chat Pacing Gate

Party-channel messages use a DB-backed pacing table,
`llm_party_chat_pacing`, keyed by `group_id`.

- Python-generated party messages reserve delivery slots through
  `tools/chatter_party_gate.py` before inserting into
  `llm_chatter_messages`.
- Final party rows carry `group_id`, `delivery_policy`, and
  `delivery_reason` so delivery can refresh the same pacing state when
  the line actually appears in game.
- C++ direct party paths that bypass Python delivery, such as
  pre-cached instant reactions and farewell packets, call
  `RecordPartyChatGateActivity()` after sending. They are not delayed,
  but they still make later filler chatter back off.
- Normal join handling pre-generates each bot's farewell after its greeting.
  A player-session rejoin deliberately skips another visible greeting, but
  still restores a persistent farewell or generates a missing one before the
  join event completes. `OnRemoveMember` can therefore send the stored line
  synchronously before deleting the session trait row.
- Policy names are `urgent`, `responsive`, `contextual`, `filler`, and
  `bypass`. Combat/state/BG/raid-critical feedback remains immediate;
  idle-style filler can defer before spending LLM tokens.

### Group serialization

The bridge processes many events in parallel, but it uses a per-group
lock so events sharing the same `group_id` do not run concurrently. This
avoids cross-talk and state races inside a single party.

Session 69 refined this with two lock lanes:

- urgent/high events and filler events for the same `group_id` no longer
  share the same queued lock lane
- this reduces the chance that queued filler work blocks queued urgent
  work for the same group

### Current priority behavior and remaining limits

The module now has meaningful end-to-end priority behavior, but it is
still not a perfect single global scheduler across every queue and
worker lane.

What priority now affects:

- event claim order from `llm_chatter_events`
- bridge scheduling, where urgent backlog suppresses or defers filler
  jobs
- pre-cache fairness during urgent backlog
- final in-game delivery ordering when priority delivery is enabled

What is still limited:

- `llm_chatter_queue` is FIFO and has no priority field
- same-executor saturation can still delay work even when claim order is
  correct
- same-group serialization still exists inside each urgency lane
- `GlobalMessageCap` and `TransportBypassGlobalCap` remain legacy config
  values and are not the main protection mechanism anymore
- provider-safety mode is bridge-side suppression logic, not a hard DB
  queue partitioning system

This is why future work should focus on validation and tuning more than
on inventing a first priority system from scratch.

## Main Bridge Loop

The bridge is **not** a single-threaded "process everything inline"
loop. It is a coordinator loop plus a worker pool.

### Coordinator thread

`llm_chatter_bridge.py` owns one long-running `while True` loop that:

- opens a DB connection for fast coordinator work
- harvests finished futures
- runs periodic cleanup SQL
- claims ready event rows from `llm_chatter_events`
- submits claimed work to worker threads
- launches background timer-like tasks when their intervals elapse
- sleeps for `LLMChatter.Bridge.PollIntervalSeconds` between iterations

### Worker pool

The bridge creates a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with:

- `max_concurrent = LLMChatter.Bridge.MaxConcurrent` for event workers
- `max_workers = max_concurrent + 4` total threads

Event rows claimed from `llm_chatter_events` run in worker threads via
`process_single_event()`, each with its own DB connection.

### Group serialization inside the worker model

Event processing is parallel by default, but group-scoped events are
submitted through `_run_with_group_lock(...)` so only one event per
`group_id` executes at a time.

### Background timer-style tasks

These are not processed inline in the same event loop body once due;
they are scheduled onto the worker pool as separate jobs:

- legacy ambient request processing from `llm_chatter_queue`
- idle group chatter checks
- bot-question checks
- pre-cache refills

So the current architecture is:

- one coordinator loop
- multiple event workers
- several interval-driven background jobs using the same executor

Session 69 added two scheduling controls around that model:

- **bridge yield mode**: legacy ambient requests, idle chatter, and bot
  questions can yield when urgent backlog exists
- **safety mode**: under sustained backlog, the bridge suppresses
  filler-first launches before sacrificing urgent work

| `src/LLMChatterProximity.cpp` | ~1700 | Ordinary outdoor/instance proximity scans, global curated NPC/playerbot eligibility and compatibility, authoritative selected/named `/say` routing, map/instance-aware scenes and cooldowns, and event payload construction |
| `src/LLMChatterProximity.h` | ~20 | Proximity scan and player-say hook declarations consumed by `LLMChatterWorld.cpp` and `LLMChatterGroupCombat.cpp` |
| `src/LLMChatterBossDialogue.cpp/.h` | ~850 | Separate boss-only pre-aggro scanning, safe-band eligibility, selected/named `/say` routing, denylist, and boss-instance presence scheduling |
| `src/LLMChatterBG.cpp` | 1348 | Battleground hooks, BG state polling, BG queue helpers, BG registration |
| `src/LLMChatterBG.h` | 14 | BG registration declaration |
| `src/LLMChatterCommand.cpp` | ~594 | Player command bridge for the Chatter Companion addon. `.llmc` command with `roster`, `get`, `set` subcommands. Percent-encoding protocol, SQL-escaped writes to `llm_bot_identities` and `llm_group_bot_traits`, config guard via `sLLMChatterConfig->IsEnabled()`, cache invalidation on trait update |
| `src/LLMChatterConfig.h/.cpp` | ~900 | Config loading, reload-safe creature-entry sets, and config struct |
| `src/llm_chatter_loader.cpp` | 11 | Module entry point, calls `AddLLMChatterScripts()` |

## Current Registration Shape

`llm_chatter_loader.cpp` calls:

- `AddLLMChatterScripts()`

`LLMChatterScript.cpp` is now the coordinator and calls:

- `AddLLMChatterWorldScripts()`
- `AddLLMChatterGuildScripts()`
- `AddLLMChatterGroupScripts()`
- `AddLLMChatterPlayerScripts()`
- `AddLLMChatterBGScripts()`
- `AddLLMChatterRaidScripts()`
- `AddLLMChatterCommandScripts()`

Current header topology is intentionally functional, not perfectly
uniform:

- `LLMChatterShared.h` declares shared helpers plus
  `AddLLMChatterWorldScripts()` and `AddLLMChatterPlayerScripts()`
- `LLMChatterGroup.h` declares `AddLLMChatterGroupScripts()` plus the
  explicit world-to-group cross-call surface
- `LLMChatterBG.h` declares BG registration

This asymmetry is known and acceptable in the shipped source state.

## Current Python Module Map

### Entry and orchestration

| File | Primary ownership |
|---|---|
| `tools/llm_chatter_bridge.py` | Main loops, event claiming, registry-driven routing, worker orchestration |
| `tools/chatter_event_registry.py` | Central Python event registry: handler module/function resolution, producer notes, payload field docs, dead-event tracking |
| `tools/chatter_ambient.py` | Ambient statement/conversation generation |
| `tools/chatter_guild.py` | Guild prompts and insert orchestration |
| `tools/chatter_guild_player.py` | Player-driven Guild replies, reply topology, session-context prompts, and rolling summary compaction |
| `tools/chatter_guild_login.py` | Real-player login greetings, responder selection, short-message prompts, and greeting pacing |

### Group domain

| File | Primary ownership |
|---|---|
| `tools/chatter_group.py` | Group join, group player message flow, idle chatter, and group-side message inserts for those paths |
| `tools/chatter_group_handlers.py` | `bot_group_*` reaction handlers, `execute_player_msg_conversation()`, thin wrappers around the shared handler pipeline for most single-reaction group events |
| `tools/chatter_handler_pipeline.py` | Shared `run_group_handler()` pipeline: extra_data parsing, guard checks, traits lookup, context assembly, prompt dispatch, chat storage, mood update, event completion/failure handling |
| `tools/chatter_group_prompts.py` | Group prompt builders, nearby-object prompts, pre-cache prompt builders, `build_player_msg_conversation_prompt()`. All major party chatter builders accept `map_id=0` and inject `get_dungeon_flavor(map_id)` as location context when inside a dungeon instance, replacing zone/subzone lore. Excluded: OOM, low-health, level-up. |
| `tools/chatter_group_state.py` | Group mood/traits/history state |
| `tools/chatter_group_general_reaction.py` | General-to-party relay: queues and handles `bot_group_general_reaction` events when grouped bots react in party chat to bot-authored General lines |

### Shared and support layers

| File | Primary ownership |
|---|---|
| `tools/chatter_shared.py` | Shared prompt, parse, count, and delay helpers |
| `tools/llm_compat.py` | OpenAI-compatible request options plus narrowly scoped parameter-rejection recovery and process-local learned overrides |
| `tools/chatter_mode.py` | Canonical normal/RP playerbot identity and channel voice rules, plus mode-invariant NPC guidance |
| `tools/chatter_text.py` | Parsing, sanitization, anti-repetition, and chat length limiting. Never slice LLM chat output by hand; use `shorten_chat_message()` or `shorten_chat_question()` from this file. |
| `tools/chatter_llm.py` | Provider/model calls for DeepSeek and Ollama; `build_llm_client()` single client factory and `get_llm_client()` cached accessor; `resolve_provider()`, `_split_prompt()`, `_build_chat_messages()`, `_ollama_user_msg()`, `_apply_deepseek_options()` for system/user prompt separation and provider tuning; delegates parameter selection and rejection recovery to `llm_compat.py`; `label=` param logs every call via `chatter_request_logger` |
| `tools/chatter_db.py` | DB access, inserts, zone/cache queries, `any_real_players_online()`, stale-group cleanup, and global group/Guild session cleanup |
| `tools/chatter_links.py` | WoW link parsing and prompt-side link enrichment for player messages |
| `tools/chatter_prompts.py` | Ambient/event prompt builders |
| `tools/chatter_general.py` | `player_general_msg` Python path |
| `tools/chatter_memory.py` | Persistent memory system: session tracking, background memory generation via `queue_memory()`, flush/activate on farewell, orphan recovery. Key helpers: `_resolve_location()`, `_ensure_cap_and_insert()`, `_count_active_memories()`, `_evict_one_used()`. Memory prompts thread `player_name` so the LLM references the player by name (DB fallback from `player_guid` when caller doesn't supply it). Length is bounded at write time by `_clamp_memory_text()` (target 160 characters, hard cap 240, trimmed at a sentence or word boundary) so prompts inject the stored memory whole instead of truncating it to 200 characters on read |
| `tools/chatter_cache.py` | Mode-aware pre-cache refill and startup removal of ready rows generated under a previous mode |
| `tools/chatter_events.py` | Event context building and cleanup |
| `tools/chatter_constants.py` | Static constants and lore data: zone names/levels/flavor, race/class speech profiles, personality traits (16 categories, 264 traits), BG lore, item/weapon/armor classification maps, item quality names/colors, raid map IDs, dungeon flavor, emote keywords |
| `tools/talent_catalog.py` | Talent description catalog used by prompt-side talent injection |
| `tools/spell_names.py` | Spell name/description loader used by DB and link helpers |

### Development tools

| File | Primary ownership |
|---|---|
| `tools/chatter_request_logger.py` | Thread-safe JSONL logger; `init_request_logger(config)` + `log_request(label, prompt, response, model, provider, duration_ms, system_prompt)`; rotation at `MaxSizeMB`; writes to `/logs/llm_requests.jsonl` inside container |
| `tools/chatter_log_viewer.py` | Zero-dependency stdlib web UI (`python chatter_log_viewer.py --log PATH --port 5555`); routes `/`, `/api/logs`, `/api/stats`; semantic prompt-section parser with colored sections; draggable column/row dividers |

### Emote reaction domain

| File | Primary ownership |
|---|---|
| `tools/chatter_emote_reaction.py` | Directed verbal reaction handler (`bot_group_emote_reaction` event) — bot responds verbally when player emotes at them |
| `tools/chatter_emote_observer.py` | Observer comment handler (`bot_group_emote_observer` event) — random group bot remarks when player emotes at a creature or nobody |

### Proximity chatter domain

| File | Primary ownership |
|---|---|
| `tools/chatter_proximity.py` | Ordinary proximity event handlers and prompt builders. Applies NPC in-world voice and configured playerbot voice independently in single or mixed-speaker scenes |
| `tools/chatter_instance_context.py` | Shared canonical map/current-area and curated dungeon-lore context used by ordinary proximity and boss prompts |
| `tools/chatter_boss_dialogue.py` | Fail-closed, history-aware message-only generation and `myell` queue insertion for boss approach and directed boss events |

### Raid/BG domain

| File | Primary ownership |

| `tools/chatter_raids.py` | PvE raid event handlers (boss, morale) |
| `tools/chatter_raid_prompts.py` | Raid prompt builders (boss, morale, battle cry, banter) |
| `tools/chatter_battlegrounds.py` | BG event handlers |
| `tools/chatter_bg_prompts.py` | BG prompt builders (lore tables moved to `chatter_constants.py`) |

## Ownership Boundaries That Matter

### Shared C++ ownership

`LLMChatterShared.cpp` owns cross-domain helpers such as:

- `EscapeString()`
- `JsonEscape()`
- `GetZoneName()`
- `GetChatterClassName()`
- `GetRaceName()`
- `BuildBotIdentityFields()`
- `QueueChatterEvent()`
- `BuildBotStateJson()`
- `AppendRaidContext()`
- `GroupHasBots()`
- `CanSpeakInGeneralChannel()`
- `GetTextEmoteName()` — reverse emote ID-to-name lookup (170+ entries)
- `SendUnitTextEmote(Unit*, uint32, const std::string&)` — consolidated
  emote packet helper; `SendBotTextEmote` overloads delegate to it
- `IsEventOnCooldown()` / `SetEventCooldown()` — shared event cooldown
  helper (cache-first, DB fallback) used by world, ambient, and nearby
- `FindCreatureBySpawnId(Map*, uint32)` — spawn-GUID creature lookup
  used by delivery and proximity
- `GetCreatureRoleName(Creature*)` — NPC role description from subname
  or NPC flags, used by proximity and nearby
- link conversion helpers
- emote/delivery helpers

Critical contract:

- direct callers of `QueueChatterEvent()` must pass `extraData` that is
  already valid JSON text and SQL-safe for insertion into a single-
  quoted SQL string literal

That contract is enforced by convention and comments, not by the type
system.

### Delivery ownership

`LLMChatterDelivery.cpp` owns:

- `DeliverPendingMessagesImpl()`
- outbound message polling from `llm_chatter_messages`
- facing selection before speech delivery
- final chat-channel dispatch for party, raid, BG, yell, General,
  say (bot `CHAT_MSG_SAY`), and msay (NPC `CHAT_MSG_MONSTER_SAY`
  with speech bubbles)
- spawn-GUID creature lookup for NPC delivery via
  `FindCreatureBySpawnId()`
- NPC orientation reset after speech via `BasicEvent`
- delivery success/retry marking

### Ambient ownership

`LLMChatterAmbient.cpp` owns:

- holiday processing
- day/night processing
- weather state and transitions
- ambient zone discovery and faction selection
- ambient chatter request queue writes

### Nearby ownership

`LLMChatterNearby.cpp` owns:

- nearby-object / nearby-creature scanning
- nearby POI helper structs and scoring helpers
- nearby-local cooldown state
- direct nearby event queue insertion path

### Proximity ownership

`LLMChatterProximity.cpp` owns:

- periodic ordinary proximity scans around alive real players
- outdoor, dungeon, and raid map policy (BGs/arenas excluded)
- humanoid NPC eligibility, disposition, rank, LOS, and delivery policy
- bot eligibility filtering (party bots only, all-bot guard rail)
- mutually compatible candidate selection and ordinary event queueing
- map/instance-scoped `ProximityScene`, history, and cooldown state
- selected/named player `/say` routing before scene fallback
- directed social-emote verbal events and their synchronized
  per-player/NPC cooldown
- mounted real players remain eligible for directed `/say` and emotes;
  mounting still suppresses automatic, untargeted, and continuation scans
- weighted selection of zero to three extra directed-scene NPCs
- strict full-name/unique-token resolution and vocative detection

`LLMChatterGroupEmote.cpp` owns animation mirroring and loads the
SmartAI/configured C++ scripted-emote exclusions used by the direct
creature mirror and verbal-reaction paths.

`LLMChatterBossDialogue.cpp` owns the distinct hostile-boss path:

- shared-classifier and denylist eligibility
- fair round-robin extended-radius safe approach scans, capped at one
  creature-grid search per configured scan pass
- calculated aggro distance plus configurable safety margin
- automatic approach and unambiguous selected/named player `/say` events
- shared per-boss-spawn/per-instance presence scheduling with randomized,
  decaying repeat opportunities and a persistent low-probability floor
- separate per-player, per-boss-spawn, per-instance directed cooldowns
- synchronized state reservations across world and map-thread hooks

`FindCreatureBySpawnId()`, `GetCreatureRoleName()`,
`LoadNamedBossCache()`, and `IsLLMChatterBoss()` live in
`LLMChatterShared.cpp` for proximity, group-kill, boss, and delivery
callers. The cache uses AzerothCore's registered creature encounters as
its authoritative dungeon/raid source, with rank, boss flag, and
single-spawn immunity metadata retained as fallbacks for unregistered
special bosses. The enter-combat reaction intentionally retains its legacy
rank/boss-flag predicate so this feature does not alter established combat
reaction probabilities.

### World ownership

`LLMChatterWorld.cpp` owns:

- `LLMChatterWorldScript`
- `LLMChatterGameEventScript`
- `LLMChatterALEScript`
- thin delivery tick delegation
- thin ambient delegation
- thin nearby delegation
- world-private `QueueEvent()`
- transport state and route announcements via transport-object zone
  transitions, but only when the destination zone currently contains a
  real player; eligible zone bots speak in General

`QueueEvent()` SQL-escapes its `extraData` before forwarding to
`QueueChatterEvent()`.

### Group ownership (five TUs)

`LLMChatterGroupInternal.h` declares shared state across the group TUs:

- struct definitions: `GroupJoinEntry`, `GroupJoinBatch`,
  `QuestAcceptEntry`, `QuestAcceptBatch`
- extern declarations for all shared cooldown maps, batch containers,
  mutexes, and emote cooldowns
- `EmoteTargetType` enum
- shared helper and domain entry-point declarations

`LLMChatterGroup.cpp` retains:

- shared state variable definitions (all cooldown maps, batch containers,
  mutexes, and emote cooldowns)
- shared helpers: `GroupHasRealPlayer`, `GetRandomBotInGroup`,
  `CountBotsInGroup`, `IsLikelyPlayerbotControlCommand`, pre-cache
  helpers
- MultiBot-Chatless bridge coexistence. `mod-multibot-bridge` owns the
  `MBOT` protocol by default. The `LLMChatter.MultiBotCompat.Enable`
  fallback is disabled by default, so chatter does not consume or block
  the addon's hidden communication. When enabled, it answers only
  startup packets (`HELLO`, `PING`, `GET~ROSTER`, `GET~STATE(S)`,
  `GET~DETAIL(S)`) for installs without the bridge
- `LoadNamedBossCache()`
- `CleanupGroupSession()` coordinator
 - thin `LLMChatterGroupPlayerScript` wrappers
 - `AddLLMChatterGroupScripts()` registration

`LLMChatterGroupCombat.cpp` owns:

- the remaining `LLMChatterGroupPlayerScript` implementation bodies for
  kill, death, loot, combat, chat, level, quest objectives, quest
  complete, achievement, spell, resurrect, corpse run, dungeon entry,
  and emote dispatch
- text-emote target classification and the decision of which paths still
  require group/bot context
- `HandleGroupPlayerUpdateZone()`
- `CheckGroupCombatState()`
- file-local `QueueStateCallout()`

`LLMChatterGroupJoin.cpp` owns:

- `QueueBotGreetingEvent()`
- `EnsureGroupJoinQueued()`
- `FlushGroupJoinBatches()`
- `LLMChatterGroupScript` (GroupScript: `OnAddMember`, `OnRemoveMember`
  with farewell, `OnDisband`)

`LLMChatterGroupEmote.cpp` owns:

- `DelayedMirrorEmoteEvent`, `DelayedCreatureMirrorEmoteEvent`
- emote static data: `s_mirrorEmoteMap`, `s_ignoredEmotes`,
  `s_combatCalloutEmotes`, `s_contagiousEmotes`
- `HandleEmoteAtGroupBot()`, `HandleEmoteAtCreature()`,
  `HandleEmoteObserver()`
- `EvictEmoteCooldowns()`

Ownership boundary:

- `LLMChatterGroupCombat.cpp` decides who/what the text emote targeted
  and whether the follow-up path is group-gated
- `LLMChatterGroupEmote.cpp` owns the actual mirror execution,
  cooldowns, and observer event queueing
- creature mirror emotes can fire even when the player is solo;
  observer chatter still requires eligible grouped bots
- emote cooldown maps are mutex-protected because text-emote hooks can run
  concurrently on map worker threads

`LLMChatterGroupQuest.cpp` owns:

- `FlushQuestAcceptBatches()`
- `LLMChatterCreatureScript` (AllCreatureScript:
  `CanCreatureQuestAccept` with debounce/immediate paths)

Important: the creature quest-accept hook is group-owned, not in a
separate creature file.

### Player ownership

`LLMChatterPlayer.cpp` owns:

- `LLMChatterPlayerScript`
- `EnsureBotInGeneralChannel()`
- `_generalChatCooldowns`
- `_subzoneCommentCooldowns` — per-group cooldown keyed by group
  counter (not per-area), shared with `ZoneTransitionCooldown` config
- `OnPlayerCanUseChat(..., Channel*)`
- General-channel bot history storage

### BG ownership

`LLMChatterBG.cpp` owns battleground-specific hooks and BG queue
helpers.

### Transport detection shape

The current transport path is intentionally an early-warning system, not
an exact dock-stop detector:

1. `LLMChatterWorld.cpp` polls live transport objects.
2. It tracks last-seen zone/map per live transport GUID.
3. A dispatch is considered only when a transport actually enters a new
   zone or map.
4. The new zone must currently contain at least one real player.
5. Eligible General-channel bot GUIDs in that zone are written into
   `extra_data.verified_bots`.
6. Cooldown is keyed by transport entry, not `transport + zone`, so one
   transport does not redispatch repeatedly during the same route cycle.

This is why transport chatter is both early enough to warn players and
cheap enough to avoid world-wide noise.

## World-To-Group Cross-Boundary

The world layer intentionally calls only a small group-owned surface via
`LLMChatterGroup.h`:

- `LoadNamedBossCache()`
- `CheckGroupCombatState()`
- `FlushQuestAcceptBatches()`
- `FlushGroupJoinBatches()`

Player-zone updates also cross from player to group via:

- `HandleGroupPlayerUpdateZone(Player*, uint32)`

Player updates also maintain live bot travel state for party prompts.
`LLMChatterPlayer.cpp` periodically calls
`UpdateGroupBotTravelState()` for grouped bots, and forced refreshes run
on zone/area changes. The persisted state is written to
`llm_group_bot_traits` (`travel_mode`, `travel_context`, mounted/flying
flags, mount display id, transport name). C++ event payloads also embed
the same state under `bot_state.travel_state` via
`BuildBotStateJson()`.

The world layer also delegates to the proximity subsystem via
`LLMChatterProximity.h`:

- `CheckProximityChatter(bool instanceMaps)` — scoped periodic scan

And `LLMChatterGroupCombat.cpp` calls into proximity via:

- `HandleProximityPlayerSay(Player*, const std::string&)` — player
  `/say` reply detection

That explicit boundary keeps the two domains easy to reason about.

## Event Routing Ownership

Bridge routing is registry-driven.

`tools/chatter_event_registry.py` is the Python-side source of truth for
live event routing metadata. At bridge startup,
`build_handler_map()` dynamically imports handler functions from that
registry and `llm_chatter_bridge.py` uses the resulting map at runtime.

- `bot_group_*` events route to group handlers
- `bot_group_emote_reaction` routes to `chatter_emote_reaction.py`
- `bot_group_emote_observer` routes to `chatter_emote_observer.py`
- `bot_group_general_reaction` routes to
  `chatter_group_general_reaction.py`
- ordinary `proximity_*` events route to `chatter_proximity.py`
- `proximity_boss_approach` and `proximity_boss_player_say` route to
  `chatter_boss_dialogue.py`
- `bg_*` events route to battleground handlers
- `player_general_msg` routes through the adapter path to
  `chatter_general.py`
- unmapped ambient work still flows through the ambient path

Signature trap that still matters:

- group handlers use `(db, client, config, event)`
- `process_general_player_msg_event` uses
  `(event, db, client, config)`
- `_dispatch_player_general_msg` exists to reorder arguments

Do not remove that adapter without standardizing the signatures.

### Player message conversation path

When a player speaks in party chat, the group player-message handler
may trigger a multi-bot conversation instead of a single-bot reply:

Known playerbot control commands do not enter this path in current
source:

- C++ `IsLikelyPlayerbotControlCommand()` in `LLMChatterGroup.cpp`
  blocks them before `bot_group_player_msg` is queued, including known
  commands following a valid Playerbot `@target` selector and
  `@command` shorthand
- Python `_is_playerbot_command()` in `chatter_group.py` remains as a
  fallback skip layer
- ordinary `@BotName` conversation and non-command text after a simple
  selector remain eligible for Chatter; valid aura and aggro selectors
  are always treated as unconditional Playerbot control traffic

1. `find_addressed_bot()` in `chatter_shared.py` always fires an LLM
   call to assess `multi_addressed` (boolean). When true and >=2 bots
   are available, the conversation path is forced (bypasses RNG).
2. Otherwise, `PlayerMsgConversationChance` (default 30%, scaled by
   bot count) gates whether a conversation fires.
3. `build_player_msg_conversation_prompt()` in
   `chatter_group_prompts.py` builds a prompt requesting a JSON array
   of 2-3 bot replies (Architecture B — single LLM call).
4. `execute_player_msg_conversation()` in `chatter_group_handlers.py`
   dispatches the call and inserts the resulting messages.
5. Delays use `calculate_dynamic_delay(responsive=True)` for faster
   player-directed timing (2s floor vs 4s ambient).

## Common Pitfalls

### `chatter_shared.py` is partly a facade

Many helpers imported from `chatter_shared.py` are actually implemented
in:

- `chatter_text.py`
- `chatter_llm.py`
- `chatter_db.py`

Do not treat `chatter_shared.py` as the default place for new Python
features just because it is imported widely. New domain logic should
usually go in the owning domain file and only small cross-domain helpers
should live here.

### Bridge ambient wrappers are delegates

If ambient behavior changes, edit `chatter_ambient.py`, not the bridge
wrapper first.

### General chat handler signature is different

Keep `_dispatch_player_general_msg` unless you standardize signatures
everywhere.

### Pre-cache path is separate from live event path

Pre-cache generation does not use the same runtime path as live group
event reactions.

### `enabledHooks` still matters

Any new C++ hook override must add the correct enum to its constructor's
`enabledHooks` vector or it will silently never fire.

### `LLMChatterScript.cpp` is registration-only

- world transport/dispatcher logic lives in `LLMChatterWorld.cpp`
- ambient world/event logic lives in `LLMChatterAmbient.cpp`
- nearby scan logic lives in `LLMChatterNearby.cpp`
- group logic lives in `LLMChatterGroup.cpp`,
  `LLMChatterGroupCombat.cpp`, `LLMChatterGroupJoin.cpp`,
  `LLMChatterGroupEmote.cpp`, `LLMChatterGroupQuest.cpp`
- player General-channel logic lives in `LLMChatterPlayer.cpp`
- shared helpers live in `LLMChatterShared.cpp`

Do not edit `LLMChatterScript.cpp` for new features.

### Battleground routing

BG-wide only:
- match start / end
- all flag events

Subgroup/party only:
- kills, node chatter, score milestones, spell/state chatter,
  idle chatter, flag-carrier self-messages

This reduces duplicate near-identical lines across party and raid.

## Database Tables
