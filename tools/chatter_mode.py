"""Canonical prompt rules for playerbot chatter modes.

Playerbots follow ``LLMChatter.ChatterMode``. Actual NPCs always remain
in-world, including when they share a proximity scene with playerbots.

The configured mode is a *default*, not a verdict. A server that wants
in-character zone chat still wants plain, focused party chat once the
group zones into a dungeon, so :func:`resolve_chatter_mode` layers a
per-channel override and an instanced-content gate on top of the global
value. Call it instead of reading ``LLMChatter.ChatterMode`` directly
wherever the channel is known.
